# Description: Install Cursor IDE (apt) + Cursor Agent CLI (user-scope) on Debian/Ubuntu
# Usage: sudo ./install/install-cursor.sh [--check] [--no-cli]
# Supports: Debian 11+ (bullseye, bookworm, trixie), Ubuntu 20.04+ (focal, jammy, noble, etc.); amd64 + arm64
#
# Why: Cursor ships TWO different products with different install shapes:
#
#   • Cursor IDE        → Debian/Ubuntu apt repo at downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo,
#                         signed by downloads.cursor.com/keys/anysphere.asc.
#                         Same shape as Google Cloud / Docker / Microsoft —
#                         signed-by keyring + sources.list.d entry. System-wide,
#                         auto-updates via `apt upgrade`.
#   • Cursor Agent CLI  → Vendor curl-bash installer at cursor.com/install.
#                         User-scope (~/.local/share/cursor-agent + ~/.local/bin
#                         symlinks `agent` and `cursor-agent`). No apt path.
#                         Vendor installer hard-codes the version, but re-publishes
#                         the URL on each release, so delegating is more durable
#                         than a version pin in this script.
#
# This script installs both by default. The IDE step needs root (apt); the CLI
# step drops privileges to $SUDO_USER so the user-scope tarball lands in the
# invoking user's home, not root's. Both steps are independently idempotent.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Idempotency check: report install state for both. Without --check or
#      --no-cli, proceed to install whichever piece is missing.
#   2. OS detection via /etc/os-release — refuses anything other than debian/ubuntu
#      (accepts derivatives — Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin, Kali — via ID_LIKE).
#   3. IDE: apt prerequisites → signing key into /etc/apt/keyrings/cursor.gpg →
#      sources.list.d entry pinned to amd64,arm64 → apt-get install cursor.
#   4. CLI (unless --no-cli): drop to $SUDO_USER and run vendor installer.
#      Symlinks land at ~/.local/bin/{agent,cursor-agent}. Warn if ~/.local/bin
#      isn't on target user's PATH (vendor installer also prints PATH hints).
#   5. Verifies both with --version probes.
#
# Flags:
#   --check      Report current install state and exit. No writes, no network.
#                Exit 0 when both pieces are installed (or just IDE if --no-cli),
#                1 when anything required is missing.
#   --no-cli     Skip the Cursor Agent CLI step. IDE-only install.
