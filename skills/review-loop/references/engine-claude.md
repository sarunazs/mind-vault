# engine-claude — Claude Code Review adapter (action + `code-review` plugin)

Adapter specification for the Claude review engine. The orchestrator at [`SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) drives this engine via the tool surface; the reference surface (this file) documents quirks the agent needs when triaging findings.

## § Citing a section of this file

Cite by a **greppable named anchor** — a phrase that is a literal substring of exactly one
heading (`§ dual substantive verdicts`, `§ slow-not-hung`, `§ A7`). Never by line number.

The economics decide it. A grep costs CPU; a wrong line number costs an agent a read of the
wrong content plus the hunt that follows, which is the expensive resource. And the failure is
silent either way: `§158` still *looks* like a working reference after the line it named has
moved. Two measurements from this file:

- Merging two branches that had each appended a calibration section moved **six** citations onto
  unrelated lines. Nothing errored; a hand-check caught it.
- `§131 + §140` was **wrong when it was written** — the two blocks it named were at 139 and 148
  in that very commit. A line number is stale from the moment the author stops counting.

All numeric citations here have been converted, each resolved against the file as it stood in
the commit that introduced it (`git log -S'§NNN'`, then read that revision) rather than guessed.
`tests/test_reference_anchors.sh` fails on any new `§NNN`, so the class cannot come back quietly.

**Writing one:** pick the distinctive words of the target heading and check
`grep -rn '<phrase>' skills/review-loop/references/` returns the heading plus your citation. If
it returns nothing, the anchor is dangling — `§Net-capability` sat dangling here for months
because the file only ever said "Net engine capability".

## ⚠️ READ THIS FIRST — the action + `code-review` plugin is NOT the managed Claude Code Review App

This engine drives `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` running the **`code-review` plugin** via a self-hosted `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` workflow (OAuth/subscription-billed). It is **NOT** Anthropic's managed *Claude Code Review* GitHub App.

| Surface | Managed App (we do NOT use) | Action + `code-review` plugin (what we drive) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Named check-run | ✅ `Claude Code Review` check-run | ❌ none — only the GitHub **Actions job** status |
| Machine-readable verdict | ✅ severity JSON | ❌ findings are plain inline + summary comments |
| Clean signal | severity JSON empty | summary-comment body substring OR zero head-SHA inline comments |

✅ **DO** read review-state off the **Actions job** of the `claude-code-review` workflow run, and clean off comment structure.

❌ **DON'T** look for a `Claude Code Review` check-run or severity JSON — anything you read at `code.claude.com/docs` describing those describes the *managed App* and **does not apply here**. There is no named check-run to poll; polling for one returns nothing and the loop hangs to HUNG.

## § Identity

- Vendor: Anthropic — `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` running the `code-review` plugin.
- Install path: **do NOT rely on `/install-github-app`'s default template — it ships `pull-requests: read` / `issues: read`, which silently blocks the action from POSTING findings** (a findings-bearing run posts nothing → `find_claude_comments.sh` reads a FALSE CLEAN via the zero-inline arm). Onboard by committing **our own write-perm templates** ([`../assets/claude-code-review.yml`](../assets/claude-code-review.yml) + [`../assets/claude.yml`](../assets/claude.yml)) to the **default branch**, porting `find_claude_comments.sh` + `claude_retrigger.sh` into `tools/`, and wiring `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. Full procedure + the anti-tampering bootstrap catch-22 (why the perms change can only take effect from the default branch): [`engine-claude-onboarding.md`](engine-claude-onboarding.md). The drop-the-two-workflows part of `/install-github-app` is fine as a starting point — but immediately replace the perms + add the guards.
- GitHub UI surface — **comment-anchored, no named check-run**:
  - Inline findings on `/pulls/<N>/comments`.
  - A top-level summary comment on `/issues/<N>/comments`.
  - The only RUNNING/DONE surface is the **GitHub Actions job** of the `claude-code-review` workflow run (`/actions/workflows/claude-code-review.yml/runs`).
- **Identity — CONFIRMED `claude[bot]`** for posted reviews (findings-bearing run, downstream non-draft PR, 2026-06-03). When the action actually POSTS a review — inline findings **and** a top-level **"Code review" summary comment** — the author login is **`claude[bot]`**.
  - ⚠️ **The PR #167 dogfood "confirmed `github-actions[bot]`" was WRONG** — it calibrated on a CLEAN run that posted *no claude content*, mistaking the workflow's PR-size-check / `github-actions[bot]` comment for claude's review. Never calibrate identity off a run that posted nothing. `find_claude_comments.sh`'s `CLAUDE_LOGINS` includes `claude[bot]` (plus `github-actions[bot]` / `claude-code-action[bot]` as harmless over-coverage), so detection was robust either way — but the doc was wrong.
  - **Inline review comments → login-only** (login ∈ `CLAUDE_LOGINS`). Review output by construction; the safe direction (over-count → keep polling, never a false clean).
  - **Summary issue comment → BOTH-AND** (login AND body signature). A findings-bearing run **does** post a "Code review" summary (e.g. "N issues found … No bugs detected" / "No bugs or security issues found"), so this arm is **live, not dead backup** — and the body signature stops a stray bot "no issues" comment faking a clean.

## § Tool invocations

- `./tools/find_claude_comments.sh <PR_NUMBER>` — probes engine reachability (below), then **surfaces review material** (IDEA-022 — it computes no clean/findings verdict; the § Verdict judge does): `CLAUDE_CHECKRUN=... STATUS=<queued|in_progress|completed> RUNS=<n> WINDOW_START=<iso>` from the **Actions job** (aggregated across all head-SHA runs), `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN=<bool>` (structural fail-closed gate), `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=<n> CLAUDE_VERDICT_IDS=<...>` (in-window verdict enumeration), `CLAUDE_LATEST_REVIEW=...` anchored on the summary-comment id (or newest head-SHA inline comment id if no summary), **verdict-body MATERIAL blocks** — every in-window summary body verbatim, each carrying `(comment id <cid>, review summary)`, UNclassified — and inline finding blocks each carrying `(comment id <cid>, review <rid>)`. May also emit `CLAUDE_NOT_INSTALLED=true` (reachability), `CLAUDE_DRAFT_NOOP=true` (draft PR — no review), `CLAUDE_REVIEW_PENDING=...` / `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT=...` (race / silent guards). No `CLAUDE_CLEAN_SIGNAL`, no `CLAUDE_HAS_FINDINGS`, no `CLEAN=` token — those were the removed prose classifier.
- `./tools/claude_retrigger.sh <PR_NUMBER>` — **fallback only.** Posts the hard-coded `@claude review once` comment. Pre-approvable in `~/.claude/settings.json`. See § Push-triggered model below — Phase 3 does NOT call this after a fix push.

**Reachability probe (A2 / R4).** `find_claude_comments.sh` probes `gh api .../actions/workflows` for `claude-code-review.yml` by filename. If the workflow is absent it emits `CLAUDE_NOT_INSTALLED=true` and exits 0, so the orchestrator's default-engine resolution can **self-exclude** claude rather than poll an un-provisioned engine to HUNG.

✅ **DO** let claude self-exclude from the *default* set on repos where the action isn't installed.

❌ **DON'T** treat `CLAUDE_NOT_INSTALLED=true` on an *explicit* `/review-loop <PR> claude` as a silent skip — it degrades **loudly**: hand back with a clear "claude action not installed (run `/install-github-app`)" message. Loud-not-silent is the contract.

## § Push-triggered for the FIRST review; EXPLICIT retrigger for every review after (A7 — CORRECTED, PR #169 self-dogfood)

The `claude-code-review.yml` action auto-runs on every push (`synchronize`), **but the `code-review` plugin skips the auto-run once claude has already posted a review on the PR** — it posts a `## Code review\n\nSkipping review — Claude has already posted a code review comment` no-op instead of a fresh review. So the push is the retrigger **only for the first review**:

- The **push auto-run produces a real review ONLY the first time** claude sees the ready PR (any push before claude has commented). 
- Every **subsequent push auto-SKIPS** → no fresh verdict (a "Skipping review …" no-op, caught by `CLAUDE_NOOP_PATTERNS`). Verified PR #169: pushes `06b3a3b` + `16e6dd4` both skip-no-op'd after the first review on `7399749`. ⚠️ **NOT universal** — a second downstream project's install **never skipped**: every push auto-run produced a full substantive review even after multiple prior reviews, so push + explicit retrigger yields **two substantive verdicts per SHA that can DISAGREE**. See § calibration update — dual substantive verdicts (below) for the masking hazard and the adapter rule.
- An **explicit `@claude review`** (`claude_retrigger.sh`) **overrides the skip and forces a fresh review.** Verified PR #169: the explicit retrigger produced a full 3-minute review where the two prior pushes had skipped. Note the explicit path posts in the **@-mention / task format** ("Claude finished @user's task … ### Code Review …") — a different shape than the auto "## Code review" summary; the catch-everything classifier (§ Review-state + clean detection) handles both.

✅ **DO** let the **FIRST** claude review come from the push / un-draft auto-run (no explicit retrigger needed before claude has commented).

✅ **DO** fire `claude_retrigger.sh` after a Phase-3 fix push **once claude has already reviewed the PR** — the push auto-run will skip, so the explicit `@claude review` is the only thing that gets a fresh verdict on the fix. **This REVERSES the prior "the push IS the retrigger, don't double-fire" guidance, which was wrong for the 2nd+ review** (the feared double-run race doesn't occur: the auto-run skips, so the explicit retrigger is the sole review).

❌ **DON'T** expect a fix push alone to re-review after claude's first comment — it skip-no-ops, and the loop will read the stale prior verdict (or a no-op) until you explicitly retrigger.

⚠️ **Double-run friction (fix-push + explicit retrigger on the SAME head SHA).** A Phase-3 fix push fires a `synchronize` auto-run *and* you then fire `claude_retrigger.sh` — **two Actions runs for one head SHA**: the auto-run skip-no-ops (claude already reviewed the PR), the explicit run produces the real verdict. Because the adapter derives `STATUS` from the *latest run by `run_started_at`*, it can report `in_progress`/`RUNNING` off whichever run started later — sometimes the skip-no-op run — **while the real verdict (a `CLAUDE_LATEST_REVIEW` summary for the head SHA, with substantive prose) is already posted.** Observed repeatedly in a multi-engine sprint-auto loop: the orchestrator polled an `in_progress` claude run for several extra cycles after the verdict was readable. Mitigation: when a `CLAUDE_LATEST_REVIEW` summary/inline set exists **for the current head SHA with substantive verdict prose** (not the in-progress checklist comment — see § Race-condition caveats), treat claude as DONE for that SHA even if the latest Actions run still shows `in_progress`; the lingering run is the skip-no-op twin. (Distinct from the no-verdict-held-RUNNING case below, which is correct — there the run is held *because* no verdict is readable.)

The retrigger script also covers the **zero-activity bootstrap**: no Actions run at all for the head SHA (fresh PR / just-installed workflow).

**Dedup.** `find_claude_comments.sh` always selects the **latest Actions run by `run_started_at`** + the newest summary comment for the head SHA, so any auto-run / fallback overlap collapses to one authoritative signal. ⚠️ **Latest-wins is only safe when at most one substantive verdict exists per SHA** — on installs where the auto-run doesn't skip (see § calibration update — dual substantive verdicts), the newest summary can be a clean verdict that MASKS an earlier findings-bearing verdict on the same SHA. Orchestrators must enumerate **every** substantive verdict for the head SHA, not trust the adapter's latest-only line.

### ⚠️ DRAFT PRs get NO posted review — the action runs but posts nothing

**On a draft PR, the Actions run fires (`synchronize` fires on draft pushes) and concludes `success`, but claude POSTS NOTHING** — no inline findings, no summary. So a draft PR reads as **SILENT / false-clean-vector**, *not* clean. Confirmed by an A/B on one commit (downstream, 2026-06-03): the same tree read SILENT while draft and posted a full review (summary + 2 inline findings) the instant the PR was marked **ready for review**. This — not `#1087` — was the actual cause of every "ran but posted nothing" result during the engine's bring-up; the `#1087` post-session-capture bug is a *separate*, rarer failure.

✅ **DO** ensure the PR is **ready-for-review (not draft)** before trusting a claude verdict; the workflow already lists `ready_for_review` in its trigger types, so un-drafting auto-fires a real review.

❌ **DON'T** read a draft PR's silence as a finding about the code — it's the draft no-op.

**Adapter belt-and-suspenders:** `find_claude_comments.sh` now probes `gh ... pulls/<PR> .draft` up-front and, on a draft PR, emits **`CLAUDE_DRAFT_NOOP=true`** + exits early (instead of fetching runs → eventually SILENT). So even if `/review-loop`'s pre-flight un-draft is skipped or fails, the loop sees a clear "no claude verdict until ready (un-draft the PR)" signal, never a misattributed SILENT/HUNG/clean. In normal flow the pre-flight un-drafts before Phase 1, so this never fires.

**✅ Use the draft no-op as a deliberate lever — the recommended sprint cadence.** claude is the only **push-triggered** engine (bugbot/copilot are on-demand inside the review-loop), so a non-draft PR auto-runs — and bills — a claude review on **every** `/work` commit push. Keep the PR in **draft during `/work`** to suppress that, iterate freely, and **flip to ready-for-review after `/wrap`** — that single un-draft fires one intentional claude review on the finalized state, which the `/review-loop` then drives alongside bugbot/copilot. Net: one billed review per cohesive change instead of one per WIP push, and no SILENT-on-WIP noise. (If you *want* a mid-`/work` claude pass, momentarily mark ready or trigger bugbot/copilot, which don't need the un-draft.)

## § Review-state + clean detection

**Review-state is synthesized from the Actions job, not a check-run.** `find_claude_comments.sh` filters `claude-code-review.yml` runs to the head SHA, picks the latest by `run_started_at`, and maps `queued`/`in_progress` → **RUNNING**, `completed` → **DONE**. The Actions `CONCLUSION` is **green whether claude found 0 or 5 issues** — it is a RUNNING/DONE signal only, NEVER a verdict. This RUNNING/DONE state, the SILENT-≠-clean hold, and the settle valve are all **structural** (machine-derived in the adapter, unchanged by IDEA-022).

**Clean/blocking/non-blocking is a MODEL JUDGMENT, not a regex (IDEA-022).** The adapter no longer classifies claude's prose with `CLAUDE_CLEAN_PATTERNS` / `CLAUDE_FINDING_MARKERS` — that string-matcher false-FINDING'd on unrecognized clean phrasing (the dogfood) and risked false-CLEAN on marker-less prose findings (the architect's hole); both are inevitable when regex parses free-form model output. The adapter is reduced to **surfacing review material** (RUNNING/DONE, the in-window verdict-body enumeration, inline findings, `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN`); the `/review-loop` orchestrator **judges that material with a model** and emits a tiered verdict. The full judge contract is **§ Verdict judge** below.

**`SILENT` (success + nothing posted) is still NOT clean — and it is structural, not a judgment.** A claude run can report `success` having posted **nothing** — action issue [#1087](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/issues/1087): the plugin buffers inline comments for a post-session step whose result-capture grabs a `TodoWrite` response instead of the review → empty → no comment. "success + silent" is **indistinguishable from genuinely-clean** ([#1054](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action/issues/1054)) by run status, so the adapter holds a no-verdict `completed` run at **RUNNING** (§ Race-condition caveats) and emits `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT` when the settle window elapses. The judge is only ever handed **posted, non-no-op material**; a SILENT run never reaches it (there is nothing to read), so the false-CLEAN-on-silence vector is closed structurally, upstream of the judge.

✅ **DO** route the clean/blocking/non-blocking decision to the § Verdict judge, reading the posted material the adapter surfaces.

❌ **DON'T** read clean off zero-inline alone, off the Actions `CONCLUSION`, or off any leftover prose-substring — and never judge a SILENT run (it posted nothing to judge; it is held RUNNING).

## § Verdict judge — the model-judge contract (IDEA-022; owns clean/blocking/non-blocking)

> Carve-out, typed to cause (not engine name). The core rule "**clean is structural, never prose**" ([`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) § Phase 1) holds for every engine with a **structured verdict surface** (bugbot/copilot post severity-tagged structured findings — a machine reads them). claude has **no structured surface**: its verdict *is* prose (§ Identity — no severity JSON, no named check-run). For a **prose-only verdict surface**, the prose IS the structural signal, and a model reading it is the classification. This carve-out is licensed by *absence of a structured surface* and applies to **any future prose-only engine**, not to claude by name.

### Structural-vs-semantic split

| Layer | Who decides | Surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RUNNING / DONE (all head-SHA runs completed?) | **adapter** (machine) | `CLAUDE_CHECKRUN ... STATUS=` aggregated across runs |
| Was a real review posted (vs draft/skip no-op, vs SILENT)? | **adapter** (machine) | `CLAUDE_NOOP_PATTERNS` filter, `CLAUDE_DRAFT_NOOP`, `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT` — a no-op/SILENT run never reaches the judge |
| Was the whole head-SHA verdict set seen (vs paginated-out)? | **adapter** (machine, fail-closed) | `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN` |
| Which substantive bodies + inline findings exist for the head SHA | **adapter** (machine) | `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=<n>` + each verdict body verbatim + inline blocks `(comment id …, review …)` |
| **clean vs blocking vs non-blocking** | **the model-judge** (orchestrator-inline) | the tiered verdict below |

The adapter surfaces material; it computes **no** clean/findings verdict. Only the last row is the judge's — and only because the surface is prose.

### The judge prompt (orchestrator-inline)

When `claude` ∈ `ENGINES` and its adapter run is **DONE with a readable verdict** (not RUNNING/PENDING/SILENT/NOOP/DRAFT), the `/review-loop` agent reads the surfaced material — **every** in-window verdict body verbatim + every head-SHA inline finding + `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN` — and judges:

> You are the review-loop's verdict judge for the claude engine. You are handed the full review material claude posted for the current head SHA: every substantive summary-comment body (verbatim), every head-SHA inline finding, and the structural facts (`CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS`, `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN`, unresolved inline-thread ids). Classify the review into exactly one tiered verdict:
>
> - **`CLEAN`** — claude found nothing that should change before merge. A genuinely-clean review (it may still *name* what it checked, e.g. "the privilege-escalation guard looks correct").
> - **`BLOCKING`** — one or more findings that must be addressed before merge. Bugs, security issues, correctness problems, convention violations claude flags as required.
> - **`NON_BLOCKING[<item>, …]`** — claude is content to merge but raised observations worth recording (e.g. "works, but you might later extract X"). Each item is `{title, why, where}`.
>
> A single review can be `BLOCKING` *and* carry `NON_BLOCKING` items — return `BLOCKING` with the non-blocking items listed alongside; blocking dominates for convergence. `CLEAN` and `NON_BLOCKING[]` both let the loop converge; only `BLOCKING` keeps it iterating.
>
> **The false-CLEAN direction is the dangerous one (IDEA-018 philosophy).** When uncertain whether an item is blocking, classify it **blocking**. Never return `CLEAN` past an unresolved concern. A "ready to merge, but one concern: …" body is **not** `CLEAN` — the concern is at least `NON_BLOCKING`, and if it names a correctness/security/convention defect it is `BLOCKING`.
>
> **Masking rule (verbatim — transcribed from § dual substantive verdicts).** Enumerate **every** substantive head-SHA body. Any unaddressed findings-bearing body keeps the verdict **`BLOCKING`** even if a newer same-SHA body reads clean — findings are addressed by fixes, never by a luckier newer roll. A clean verdict never overrides an earlier findings verdict on the same SHA.
>
> **Proven-set fail-closed (structural, non-overridable).** If `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN` is not `true`, you **cannot** return `CLEAN` — the adapter could not prove it saw the whole verdict set (paginated-out / blank run timestamps / no run window), so a clean read can't rule out a masked earlier verdict. Return `BLOCKING` (re-poll / re-trigger) until the set is proven.
>
> When you return `CLEAN` over a posted summary body, **record which body id you cleared and the one-line reason** — a clean verdict over substantive prose must be auditable.

### Backstop — stated honestly (architect C1; no "guarded two ways" overclaim)

The never-false-CLEAN bias has **two different anchors depending on finding shape**, because claude's *common* finding shape is **summary-body-only with zero inline threads** (§ calibration update — findings live in the SUMMARY BODY; the ~30-docstring real case):

- **Inline-thread findings** → the structural anchor holds: an unresolved head-SHA inline thread ⇒ the judge must not return `CLEAN` (machine-countable).
- **Summary-body-only findings** → there is **no inline-thread anchor** (the signal *is* prose). The guard here is the **judge instruction** (false-CLEAN-dangerous) **plus** the structural **proven-verdict-set requirement** (`CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN` fail-closed). The judge may return `CLEAN` only over a verdict set the adapter proved whole.

So: structural where a structural signal exists (inline threads, proven-set, masking enumeration); judge-instruction where the signal is irreducibly prose. Not "guarded two ways" everywhere — guarded by whatever anchor the finding shape affords.

### Fixture taxonomy (drives the tests — § Verification / `tests/`)

The judge contract is gated **asymmetrically** (architect C2 — moving classification to a model loses the deterministic CI gate, so restore it only on the dangerous direction):

- **Hard-gated (false-CLEAN direction; the structurally-detectable part runs in bash CI):**
  - **summary-body-only blocking finding** (the `:176` ~30-docstring shape) — the adapter MUST surface the body verbatim so the judge sees the concern.
  - **dual-verdict masking** (newer clean body masks an earlier findings-bearing body on the same SHA) — the adapter MUST enumerate **both** bodies (`CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=2`), so a masked verdict can never be invisible to the judge.
  - **unprovable verdict set** — `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN=false` MUST hold, structurally forbidding a `CLEAN` judgment.
  - **marker-less prose finding** ("ready to merge; one concern: no auth check on the new endpoint") — the adapter MUST surface the body verbatim; the *NOT-CLEAN reading* of it is the judge's (no structural signal distinguishes it from clean prose — that is exactly why it needs a model, and why this specific reading is **judge-eval / advisory**, not a bash assertion).
- **Advisory (safe boundary; model variance is a calibration signal, not a build break):** the `CLEAN`-vs-`NON_BLOCKING` boundary — e.g. the dogfood `4729548936` "all findings resolved / ready to merge" recap should read `CLEAN` (or `NON_BLOCKING`), the original false-positive gone; a pure suggestion reads `NON_BLOCKING`.

**What the bash hard-gate can and cannot assert** (architect C1, honest): bash deterministically gates that **the dangerous material is always surfaced to the judge** (verbatim bodies, full verdict enumeration) **and the structural fail-closed holds** (`CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN`, masking enumeration). The semantic NOT-CLEAN *reading* of pure prose is the model's job — covered by the judge instruction + the advisory eval, not a deterministic bash assertion. The machine guarantees the judge can't be starved of the concern; the model guarantees it reads the concern correctly.

## § Staleness rule

Keyed on **comment ids** (synthesized anchor), not a review id. `CLAUDE_LATEST_REVIEW` = the summary-comment id, or the newest head-SHA inline comment id when no summary exists. Each inline finding carries `(comment id <cid>, review <rid>)`; whether the inline comments share a single `pull_request_review_id` is **unconfirmed** (Q1, § residual open questions) — the anchor keys on the comment id either way, so the rule is safe regardless. When `<rid>` is null/absent the orchestrator tolerates an empty review token for comment-anchored engines.

## § Race-condition caveats

**The settle valve releases on comment PRESENCE, not Actions conclusion (A3 — load-bearing).** This is the divergence from copilot's `CONCLUSION=success` settle gate. claude's Actions job flips to `completed` *before* its summary/inline comments post — a poll in that gap sees DONE + zero findings → false CLEAN.

So a `completed` Actions run with **no readable verdict** (no posted findings AND no clean summary) is held at `STATUS=in_progress` (RUNNING) so the orchestrator's "DONE + zero findings = CLEAN" can't fire on it. The settle window (`CLAUDE_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS`, default **180**) only picks the marker — it never releases a no-verdict run to DONE:

- **within window** → `CLAUDE_REVIEW_PENDING` (comments may still be landing — race).
- **window elapsed** → `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT` (nothing came → **NOT clean**: #1087 drop / read-only perms / un-fixed workflow). Stays RUNNING; the loop hands it back as uncertain (re-trigger / verify perms), never auto-clean.

**Settle window is 180s, not copilot's 600 (calibrated PR #167).** claude-code-action posts its inline comments *synchronously within the job* — the post step runs **before** the run reports `completed`, so comments (if any) already exist at completed-time. The window only covers GitHub API read-consistency after that in-job post, not copilot's minutes-long async-review lag.

✅ **DO** treat `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT` as uncertain/needs-retrigger — never clean.

❌ **DON'T** copy copilot's `CONCLUSION=success` settle gate, and DON'T release a no-verdict run to DONE on settle-elapse (the original "zero-inline arm" — that's the #1087 false-CLEAN). claude concludes `success` even WITH findings, so conclusion is never consulted.

Settle age is computed in Python `datetime` (cross-platform), never `date -d`.

## § Failure modes

| Symptom | Detection | Orchestrator action |
|---|---|---|
| claude action not installed | `CLAUDE_NOT_INSTALLED=true` (no `claude-code-review.yml` workflow on the repo) | Self-exclude from the **default** set (bare `/review-loop`); on an **explicit** `claude` run, degrade **loudly** — hand back with "run `/install-github-app`", never HUNG, never silent. |
| **Draft PR (no review posted)** | `CLAUDE_DRAFT_NOOP=true` — the PR `.draft` is `true` (adapter early-exits) | Not a verdict — the draft no-op. `/review-loop` pre-flight should have un-drafted (`gh pr ready`); if this still fires, un-draft and re-poll. NEVER read as clean/SILENT/HUNG. |
| claude stalled | Actions job `STATUS=in_progress` (RUNNING) past observed latency on `last_push_sha` — **but claude's normal latency is long (up to ~17 min on a large PR); confirm genuinely wedged, not merely slow — see § slow-not-hung** | Proceed with other engines' findings if any; do NOT explicitly retrigger (push-triggered — the next fix push re-runs it). **Before treating it as stalled, run the § slow-not-hung checks (step-progress + verdict re-fetch).** Surface in hand-back if it doesn't recover within the idle-poll budget. |
| Actions job unreadable | `actions: read` blocked for the user's `gh` auth — `WORKFLOW_RUNS` empty, no `CLAUDE_CHECKRUN` (Q3) | Degrade to summary-comment-only state (lose the RUNNING signal) with a logged warning. Do NOT hard-fail the loop. |
| **Silent run (success + nothing posted)** | `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT=...` — run `completed`/`success` but NO findings and NO clean summary after settle (held RUNNING) | **NOT clean.** Hand back as uncertain: re-trigger once, and verify the workflow has the reliability fixes + `pull-requests: write` (LAYER 1/2). Most likely the #1087 buffer-drop, a read-only-perms posting block, or an un-fixed/old workflow — never read as a clean pass. Don't wait for the full idle-timeout; the SILENT marker is the terminal signal. **Anchor: a *first* un-draft/initial auto-run came back SILENT (#1087) and a single explicit `claude_retrigger.sh` then produced a full verdict — the retrigger recovery works on the first review too, not only after a fix push. Its first response may be the in-progress checklist (§ Race-condition caveats), so wait for the checklist to resolve / a substantive verdict to post before judging.** |

**Robust-mode alternative (record-only).** #1087 is an *open* upstream bug — the workflow fixes *mitigate* (post-during-run) but don't *guarantee* (the model can still end on a `TodoWrite` before posting). For guaranteed reliability, Anthropic's **managed Code Review GitHub App** (`@claude review`, Team/Enterprise) writes findings to **check-run annotations** independent of the comment buffer — but it's paid (~$15–25/review), research-preview, and unavailable under Zero Data Retention. If a project hits persistent SILENT despite the fixes, the managed App is the escalation path (a different adapter — it *does* post a named check-run, unlike this action path). Tracked in IDEA-012.

## § Actions billing wall — jobs fail at startup, NOT a code/engine problem

On a **private repo** GitHub-hosted Actions minutes are metered. When the account exhausts its included minutes (or a payment fails / the spending limit sits at $0), **every** workflow — claude-review included — stops at **job startup**: the run is `conclusion=failure`, `STATUS=completed`, `runner=""`, `steps: []`, finishes in ~2 s, and `gh run view --log-failed` returns "log not found". The real reason is in the check-run **annotation**: *"The job was not started because recent account payments have failed or your spending limit needs to be increased."* (`gh api repos/{O}/{R}/check-runs/{id}/annotations`).

**Distinguish from a real engine failure**: a genuine claude failure runs its steps (logs exist, duration ≫ seconds). A billing wall produces **no steps + sub-2s duration across UNRELATED workflows at the same instant** (e.g. claude-review AND a trivial lint/size check both fail in the same second). That signature = **account billing, not the engine**.

Orchestrator action: **surface to the user** (Settings → Billing & plans — raise the Actions spending limit or fix the payment method), **do NOT retrigger** (the rerun also fails to start, burning the loop's budget on a wall it can't clear), and **never read it as a claude verdict**. Only the Actions-based engine (claude) is affected — app-based engines (bugbot/copilot) keep working, so a multi-engine loop can still make partial progress. Anchor: a heavy multi-PR review day exhausted a private repo's monthly minutes mid-afternoon; reruns succeeded the moment the spending limit was raised.

## § slow-not-hung — don't escape-hatch a long claude run on elapsed time alone

claude's review legitimately runs **much longer than bugbot/copilot** — observed up to **~17 min** on a large multi-file PR (vs the ~1–9 min seen on small diffs). The multi-engine stall escape-hatch ([`multi-engine-sync.md`](multi-engine-sync.md) § Trade-off escape hatch) must therefore **not** fire on elapsed wall-time alone — that's how a still-working run gets abandoned one beat before it posts.

Field near-miss (the source of this note): a ~17-min run was treated as hung and superseded by a fix push; it then posted real findings essentially immediately after — the supersede had thrown them away, and a human surfaced the missed findings by hand. Two findings were lost to the loop.

Before tripping the escape-hatch on claude:

1. **Confirm genuinely wedged, not just slow.** Read the Actions job's *step progress*, not just elapsed time: `gh run view <run-id>` (or `--json jobs`). A job advancing through steps is working; a job parked on one step well past its normal duration is wedged. *No step movement* is the wedged signal — elapsed-since-start is not.
2. **Re-fetch for a late-posted verdict FIRST.** Re-run `find_claude_comments.sh` immediately before superseding — claude posts its summary/inline comments synchronously near the **end** of the job (§ Settle window), so a run that was verdict-less five minutes ago may have just posted. A supersede that skips this re-check is the exact shape of the near-miss.
3. **Raise the stall ceiling for claude specifically.** Whatever per-engine stall threshold the loop carries, claude's must sit comfortably above its ~17-min observed worst case — a ceiling tuned to copilot/bugbot's minutes mis-classifies a healthy claude run as hung.

This pairs with the RUNNING-state machine (§ Review-state gate): a `completed` Actions run with no readable verdict is held at RUNNING precisely so the loop can't read a no-verdict run as CLEAN — and the same discipline says **don't read a still-RUNNING run as hung** until step-progress proves it. (It also pairs with the C1 calibration: even once it posts, claude's findings often live only in the summary BODY, so a too-early supersede skips them twice over — never fetched, never surfaced.)

## § Common patterns (codified Tier 1)

The codified Tier-1 catalogue is shared across engines — see [`common-review-findings.md`](common-review-findings.md). No claude-specific deltas at present; claude's behavioral quirks live in § Review-state + clean detection and § Race-condition caveats above. (claude's comment-body finding markers are now calibrated — see § calibration update — findings live in the SUMMARY BODY; the severity stamp on a summary-body finding is a heuristic, re-triaged by the loop.)

## § Review-state gate

claude exposes its review-state as `CLAUDE_CHECKRUN ... STATUS=<status>` **synthesized from the Actions job** (there is no native check-run — see the trap banner at the top). `queued`/`in_progress` = **RUNNING**, `completed` = **DONE**; `CONCLUSION` is never a verdict.

**Clean for claude**: Actions job DONE (all head-SHA runs `completed`) AND the **§ Verdict judge** returns `CLEAN` or `NON_BLOCKING[]` over the surfaced material (IDEA-022 — clean is a model judgment for this prose-only surface, not a regex). The review-pending guard (§ Race-condition caveats) holds the loop in RUNNING until a head-SHA comment posts, so the DONE-before-comments gap cannot fire a false CLEAN; a SILENT run is held RUNNING and never reaches the judge. The orchestrator retriggers only from the zero-activity bootstrap (push-triggered otherwise) and never while RUNNING, so no inter-retrigger interval exists.

> **⚠️ IDEA-022 supersession (regex mechanism → judge input).** The calibration blocks below were written to tune the **regex classifier** (`CLAUDE_CLEAN_PATTERNS` / `CLAUDE_FINDING_MARKERS` / `is_clean`), which IDEA-022 **removed** — the clean/blocking/non-blocking decision is now the **§ Verdict judge** (a model reading the prose). The *classification mechanism* these blocks describe is gone. Their *behavioral observations* — findings often live only in the summary BODY; clean is whole-review not substring; two substantive verdicts on one SHA can disagree; no-op/skip bodies aren't verdicts; clean now usually posts on both paths — are **exactly the material the judge reasons over**, so they remain load-bearing as judge input. Read them as "what claude's prose looks like in the wild," not "what regex to match."

## § calibration update — the RUN-STATE query cannot see a retriggered review, and reports the skip as DONE (downstream, 2026-08-25)

🔴 **The adapter reported `STATUS=completed CONCLUSION=success` while the review was still running.**
Acting on that marks a PR reviewed that nobody reviewed — the failure the whole gate exists to
prevent, reproduced one layer up in the gate itself.

`CLAUDE_CHECKRUN` is synthesized from runs of **one** workflow file, filtered to the PR head SHA. A
retrigger satisfies **neither** condition, for two independent reasons:

| | workflow file | event | `head_sha` it reports |
|---|---|---|---|
| push auto-run | `claude-code-review.yml` | `pull_request` | the PR head ✅ |
| retrigger (`@claude review once`) | **`claude.yml`** | `issue_comment` | **the default-branch tip**, `head_branch=main` |

So the retrigger's run is invisible twice over — and **fixing only the workflow-file list would not
have fixed it**, because head-SHA filtering drops it anyway. Meanwhile the run the query *can* see
is the auto-run, which skip-no-ops in ~1 s with `success` once a review exists on the PR. Green, and
nothing reviewed.

⚠️ **The adapter's own header asserted these two "collapse to one authoritative signal" via
latest-`run_started_at`.** That claim *was* the bug, written down as a design note — the dedup
silently assumes a single workflow. When a comment explains why something is safe, check whether the
explanation is load-bearing before trusting it.

**The fix — stop guessing at workflows and SHAs; use the link the platform already provides.** Every
claude comment carries `[View job run](.../actions/runs/<id>)`: GitHub's own comment→run
correlation, authoritative and independent of file name and event type. Harvest those ids from
claude-authored comment bodies and fold each run's status in under the aggregation rule the adapter
already used — **any non-completed run holds the engine RUNNING**. Properties that make it safe in
both directions, and which a careless reimplementation loses:

- Stale ids from earlier SHAs are `completed`, so folding them is a no-op.
- A run that cannot be read (404, no `actions: read`) is **UNKNOWN, which counts as not-completed** —
  degrade to RUNNING, never to a false DONE.
- Cap the number of ids so a long thread cannot fan out into unbounded API calls.
- Emit `LINKED_RUNS` / `LINKED_INCOMPLETE` / `LINKED_HOLDING=<ids>` so *"nothing linked"* and
  *"everything linked finished"* are distinguishable instead of both reading as silence.

## § calibration update — the verdict comment has THREE body stages, and only the third is a verdict (downstream, 2026-08-25)

The bot edits **one comment id** in place through three distinct bodies:

1. `Claude Code is working… / I'll analyze this and get back to you.` — short, and carries **no
   checkboxes at all**
2. a `- [ ]` todo list
3. `**Claude finished @user's task in <t>**` + the answer

🔴 **A watcher gated on *"no unchecked `- [ ]` boxes"* returns SETTLED in ~17 s, on stage 1.** The
absence of an in-flight marker is not the presence of a verdict. This file already records the
mirror-image failure — gating on the `Claude Code is working` string reported settled on a todo list
still in flight — so both single-signal gates have now been measured failing, in opposite directions.

**Gate on the POSITIVE marker, and require all three:** body matches `claude finished`, **and** no
`- [ ]` remains, **and** the run id parsed from the comment's own `[View job run](...)` link reports
`completed`. Each condition alone admits a different stage. `created_at` never moves across the three,
so a watcher keyed on comment count or creation time sees nothing happen at all.

## § calibration update — a PR opened in an EARLIER SESSION may already carry an unread review (downstream, 2026-08-25)

Reported a PR as "open, awaiting merge" across a session boundary. It had been reviewed **four hours
earlier**, with three real findings — one wrong unit, one ordering violation, and a count contradicted
by a table four lines below it — none of which had been read. The loop discipline was being applied
carefully to the PR opened *this* session while the older one was described from memory of having
opened it.

**Enumerate verdicts on every PR you report the status of, not only the one you are actively
iterating on.** "I opened it and nothing has happened since" is an assumption about elapsed time, and
review is exactly the thing that happens while you are not looking. Cheap control: before saying a PR
is ready, list its comment ids and count them.

## § calibration update — findings-bearing + clean runs (downstream non-draft, 2026-06-03)

Two runs on the SAME commit, non-draft, settled the open questions:

- **Findings-bearing run → POSTS a full review.** ~9-minute run; posted inline findings + a top-level **"Code review" summary** ("N issues found … No bugs detected") under **`claude[bot]`**. So claude **does** post findings reliably on a ready-for-review PR — the long-pending findings-path question is answered YES.
- **Clean run → SILENT (still).** After the findings were fixed, the re-review on the clean tree finished in **~1 minute** and posted **nothing** — no inline, no summary — well past settle → `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT`. **The LAYER-2 forced-summary prompt does NOT fire on a clean run**: the action short-circuits ("nothing to flag") and exits without posting the "no issues found" summary it was instructed to post. So the mitigation works for *findings* but not for *clean*.

**Net engine capability (action + `code-review` plugin):** posts **findings** reliably. ⚠️ **The "never posts a positive clean verdict — a clean PR reads SILENT" claim below is OUTDATED as of 2026-06-08 — see § COUNTER-OBSERVATION** (clean verdicts now post on both trigger paths; likely an upstream fix). The historical claim, preserved for context: a clean PR read SILENT (correctly held non-clean by the detection, so SAFE, but never a green "claude says clean"), so claude contributed findings only, never a CLEAN signal. That was the basis for IDEA-012 keeping the **managed Claude Code Review App** (named check-run, verdict independent of the comment buffer) as the robust-mode answer — still the most reliable, but the action path now does usually post clean.

## § calibration update — findings live in the SUMMARY BODY (downstream, 2026-06-03)

The first *high-volume* findings-bearing run (13 `claude[bot]` summary comments across a long iteration) exposed that the prior "findings = inline comments + a short summary" model **undercounts where claude puts findings**. CALIBRATED against the real bodies; the adapter (`find_claude_comments.sh`) was fixed to match (the **C1** fix). Corrections (the last two added by the PR #169 self-dogfood — running this engine on the PR that ships C1):

- **Findings often post ONLY in the summary BODY, not inline.** claude's convention findings (CLAUDE.md docstring violations) and cross-file findings it can't line-anchor (privilege-escalation spanning a form + a view) are written as a structured report **inside the `claude[bot]` "## Code review" issue-comment body** — `### Bugs / Security`, `#### 1. …`, `### CLAUDE.md compliance / Docstrings missing …` — with **zero inline comments**. The old adapter only read the summary body for the clean substring, never surfaced its findings → claude's convention review was **invisible to the loop** (the user surfaced ~6 URL + ~30 docstring findings by hand). Fix: the adapter now surfaces a findings-bearing summary body as a finding block carrying `(comment id <cid>, review summary)`.
- **The summary heading is literally `## Code review` (space), which the old `code-review` (hyphen) signature did NOT match** → the whole summary was unrecognized. Signature widened to `code[ -]?review`.
- **Clean is WHOLE-REVIEW, not substring-anywhere.** claude clears sections independently: a single review says **"Bugs: No issues found."** in one section AND lists **"Docstrings missing"** in another. A bare `'no issues found' in body` test **false-cleans** that mixed review (the dangerous direction). Clean requires a positive clean phrase (`no issues/bugs/problems found`) AND the **absence of any finding marker** (structural, not security-keyword: a genuinely-clean review NAMES the concepts it checked, e.g. *"the privilege-escalation guard looks correct"*, so `privilege`/`escalation` as markers false-positive on clean prose). Re-validated against all 13 downstream bodies (2026-06-03): **3 NOOP, 9 FINDINGS** (incl. every mixed clean-bugs-but-dirty-compliance review), **1 CLEAN** (the final whole-review verdict) — **zero false-cleans** (the PR body's "2 NOOP / 10" was an off-by-one miscount; all three `Skipped` bodies are genuine no-ops).
- **No-op skip bodies must be filtered — ANCHORED.** claude posts `## Code review\n\nSkipped — …draft status` and `## Code review\n\nSkipped: …already reviewed this PR` issue comments that match the signature but are **not verdicts**. Anchored to the heading-then-`Skipped` shape (`^##\s+code[ -]?review\s*\n+\s*skipped`, `re.MULTILINE`) — **not** a bare search-anywhere — so a real findings body whose *prose* merely says "already reviewed in PR #N but regressed" is not false-filtered (PR #169 self-dogfood caught the old unanchored `already (posted|reviewed)` arm dropping exactly that — claude's finding body literally contained "already reviewed").
- **Surface is CATCH-EVERYTHING, marker-INDEPENDENT (PR #169 self-dogfood).** Review format is **non-deterministic** — count-line ("One issue found.") + ``### `file` `` headers in one run, `#### 1.` numbered + `### Bugs` sections in another, future runs may differ again. So the adapter does **not** require a matched marker to surface findings: a posted, non-no-op summary is **either provably-clean OR surfaced-as-findings** (`findings = posted ∧ ¬clean`). Markers now only gate the *clean* determination + severity. An unseen future finding shape therefore can never read SILENT. (The dogfood: claude posted "One issue found." under ``### `file` `` while reviewing this adapter; the marker-only logic read SILENT and dropped it — the inversion + anchored no-op are the fix.)

This does **not** change the findings-side capability: claude posts findings reliably; the C1 fix only stops claude's *findings* — when they exist and live in the body — from being silently dropped. (The "never a positive clean verdict / clean reads SILENT" half of this is **outdated as of 2026-06-08** — see § COUNTER-OBSERVATION; clean verdicts now post on both paths.)

## § COUNTER-OBSERVATION — clean trees DO post a positive clean verdict, on BOTH paths (PR #190 + #192, 2026-06-08)

Two independent, reproducible data points **against** the "clean always reads SILENT" claim above — now confirmed on **both** trigger paths, so the § findings-bearing + clean runs SILENT-on-clean behavior is no longer the whole story:

- **Observation 1 — explicit-retrigger path (PR #190).** First claude run fired on `ready_for_review` over a tree with one real (bugbot-found) finding → claude went **SILENT** (run `completed`, posted nothing — the expected #1087 / short-circuit behavior). The finding was fixed, pushed, and claude was **explicitly retriggered via `claude_retrigger.sh`** (`@claude review` / `claude.yml`). On the clean post-fix tree it posted a **positive whole-review clean summary** — `find_claude_comments.sh` read `CLAUDE_SUMMARY_ID=… CLEAN=true FINDINGS=false`, loop terminated structurally **CLEAN** off claude.
- **Observation 2 — push / auto-run path (PR #192).** On the *first* claude review of a clean tree (the PR-open auto-run on `claude-code-review.yml`, **no retrigger**), claude **again posted a positive clean summary** → `CLEAN=true FINDINGS=false`, structurally CLEAN. This is the path § findings-bearing + clean runs said short-circuits to SILENT on clean — and here it did not.
- **What this changes.** The **push-vs-retrigger asymmetry hypothesis is WEAKENED** — claude posted a positive clean verdict on *both* paths within the same day. The § findings-bearing + clean runs "clean run → SILENT (still)" + § Net engine capability "never posts a positive clean verdict" claims are at minimum **no longer reliably true**; the most likely explanation is **upstream improvement to the action's clean-path posting** (a `code-review`-plugin or `claude-code-action` update between the § findings-bearing + clean runs calibration and 2026-06-08), not a path-specific quirk. Still possible: SILENT-on-clean recurs intermittently (the #1087 buffer-drop is an *open* upstream bug), so this is "clean verdicts now usually post" — NOT "SILENT-on-clean is impossible."
- **Loop consequence (unchanged for safety).** Detection is structural (clean = DONE + posted clean summary + zero finding markers), so a posted clean verdict reads CLEAN correctly and any residual SILENT run still reads NOT-clean. The adapter needs no change to be *safe*. What changes is *reliance*: claude **can now usually be a CLEAN source** (both paths observed). Treat a clean claude verdict as a real signal; but because SILENT-on-clean can still recur (open #1087), do **not** hard-depend on claude being the *sole* clean gate — keep a second engine (bugbot) when a definitive clean matters. Promote further (drop the "usually") only if SILENT-on-clean goes unseen across a longer run of clean PRs.

## § calibration update — clean summary CAN coexist with inline-only findings; progress comments are not verdicts (downstream, 2026-06-11)

Two adapter blind spots observed in one loop run on a downstream project, both in the *summary-trusting* direction (the dangerous one):

- **A clean-prose summary does NOT imply zero findings.** One run posted **3 inline finding comments** (each as its **own separate review object**, seconds apart) and then, ~10s later, a summary whose prose read clean → the adapter emitted `CLEAN=true FINDINGS=false` while 3 active inline findings sat on the head SHA. This is the **inverse** of the § findings live in the SUMMARY BODY calibration (findings only-in-summary-body): findings can also be **only-inline with a clean-reading summary**. Consequence for orchestrators and the adapter: **never derive the findings count from the summary body** — enumerate `/pulls/<n>/comments` for the head SHA's review ids independently, every cycle, and require zero active inline findings *in addition to* a clean summary. (The structural-clean rule in the core skill already demands this; the trap is an adapter summary line that *looks* like it did the enumeration.)
- **In-flight progress comments match the verdict signature.** The action edits a `## Code review` issue comment *while working* — task checklist with unchecked `- [ ]` items ("Post findings" unchecked) + a "View job run" link. On the explicit-retrigger path this progress comment exists **while the prior push's check-run reads `completed`** (the retrigger run is a *different* workflow run, often under `claude.yml`, not the `claude-code-review.yml` check-run the adapter watches), so the adapter read it as a findings-bearing verdict (`CLEAN=false FINDINGS=true`) mid-run. Markers for not-a-verdict: unchecked checklist items, absence of any findings/clean section, "Claude finished" header missing. Treat such a body as RUNNING regardless of any check-run state the adapter resolved.
- **Q1 (below) is now answered**: inline findings do **not** share one `pull_request_review_id` — each inline comment posted as its own single-comment review. The comment-id staleness anchor (§ Staleness) handles this correctly; review-id-based grouping would have read "3 reviews" as 3 separate passes.

## § residual open questions (post-downstream calibration)

The two 2026-06-03 downstream blocks (§ findings-bearing + clean runs, § findings live in the SUMMARY BODY) supersede the PR #167 first-run calibration — identity (`github-actions[bot]` → **`claude[bot]`**), the dead "zero-inline-only, no summary" posting model, and `CLAUDE_BODY_SIGNATURES` wording are all now confirmed. Two items survive it:

- **Never calibrate "clean" off a read-only (`pull-requests: read`) run.** The PR #167 run read clean only because it had nothing to flag; read-only silently **cannot post**, so a *findings-bearing* read-only run would fail to post → false CLEAN. Fix is `pull-requests: write` + `issues: write` (§ Identity + onboarding reference).
- **Still open:** **Q2** — the `claude_retrigger.sh` `@claude review once` fallback is now exercised (2026-06-11 downstream: the comment trigger fired a fresh review that posted a full verdict) — confirmed working. **Q1** — ANSWERED 2026-06-11 (see the calibration block above): inline findings post as separate single-comment reviews, no shared review id; the comment-id anchor keys correctly either way.

## § calibration update — dual substantive verdicts on one SHA; the skip-no-op is install-dependent (second downstream, 2026-06-11)

A second downstream project falsified § A7's "subsequent pushes auto-skip" model on its install, and the failure it produced is the most dangerous shape yet observed — a **false CLEAN hand-back**:

- **The auto-run does NOT reliably skip.** On this install, every push's `synchronize` auto-run produced a **full substantive review** even after claude had reviewed the PR multiple times. With Phase 3's explicit retrigger also firing, each fix push yielded **two complete, independent reviews of the same head SHA**.
- **Two substantive verdicts on one SHA can DISAGREE.** Observed concretely: the push auto-run posted a findings-bearing review (multiple real correctness findings), then the explicit-retrigger run posted `No issues found` on the **same commit** minutes later. Engine nondeterminism — same diff, opposite verdicts. The newest-summary-wins dedup picked the clean one, the loop reported CLEAN, and the findings were only caught because the human read the PR thread.
- **Adapter/orchestrator rule (supersedes latest-only reading):** treat the engine as DONE only when **all** Actions runs for the head SHA are `completed` AND no claude comment is in the WIP-checklist state; then read **every** substantive claude verdict posted for that SHA. Any findings-bearing verdict with unaddressed findings keeps the engine **STILL_FINDING**, even when a newer verdict on the same SHA reads clean. A clean verdict never overrides an earlier findings verdict — findings are addressed by fixes, not by a luckier second roll.
- **Epistemics of disagreement:** a findings-bearing verdict is strong evidence (specific, checkable claims — verify each against source); a clean verdict is weak evidence (absence-of-findings on one sample). When verdicts disagree, the findings verdict wins by default.
- **Why installs differ** is unresolved — candidate variables: `claude-code-action` / `code-review`-plugin version skew between repos, workflow-config differences (the skipping install vs the non-skipping install were set up weeks apart). Until root-caused, treat skip-no-op as an **optimization some installs have**, never as a correctness assumption: the Phase-3 explicit retrigger stays (it's the only guaranteed fresh verdict), and the dual-verdict reading rule above makes the double-run harmless.
- **Adapter implementation** (`find_claude_comments.sh`, IDEA-022 — material-surfacing, not classification): Pass 1 aggregates `STATUS` across **all** head-SHA Actions runs (completed only when every run completed; metadata from the latest) and emits `RUNS=` + `WINDOW_START=` (earliest head-SHA run start). Pass 2b **enumerates** every substantive non-no-op summary with `created_at >= WINDOW_START` (issue comments carry no commit id — the run window IS the SHA scope) and emits `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=` / `CLAUDE_VERDICT_IDS=`, plus each verdict body **verbatim** as a `(comment id …, review summary)` material block (oldest-first) — it does **not** classify them findings/clean. The **§ Verdict judge** applies the masking rule over that surfaced set (any unaddressed findings-bearing body keeps the verdict BLOCKING even if a newer same-SHA body reads clean). The structural fail-closed stays in the adapter: `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN=false` whenever the verdict set is unproven (no run window, blank run timestamps), and the judge is forbidden CLEAN under it. (Pre-IDEA-022 this was a regex `CLAUDE_HAS_FINDINGS` classification + clean-signal suppression — removed; the judge subsumes it.)

## § calibration update — the @-mention TASK SHAPE is a full verdict surface the summary signature missed (mind-vault PR #221 self-dogfood, 2026-07-15)

§ A7's note that the explicit retrigger "posts in the @-mention / task format" undersold the consequence: on mind-vault's own install, that shape was **invisible to the adapter for 4 consecutive cycles** while it carried the PR's only outstanding blocking finding.

- **The dual-stream reality.** A retriggered cycle produces TWO parallel claude streams: the push's `claude-code-review.yml` auto-run posts (or skip-no-ops) the `## Code review` summary shape, while the explicit `@claude review` comment is answered by **`claude.yml`** (the @-mention handler) in the **task shape** — `**Claude finished @<user>'s task in <t>**` header, a *model-generated* heading below it (`### Review complete` observed; `### Code Review` seen elsewhere), findings in the body, posted as `claude[bot]`.
- **The leak.** The summary filter is BOTH-AND (login AND `CLAUDE_BODY_SIGNATURES`). The task-shape body contained no "code review" phrase, so it failed the signature → excluded from the summary anchor AND from the Pass 2b head-SHA verdict enumeration. Observed sequence on PR #221: cycles 1–2 the coexisting auto-run summary said "No issues found" → judge read CLEAN while the task shape flagged a real `A && B || C` bug; cycles 3–4 no summary posted at all → `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=0` → UNPROVEN → the loop declared claude SILENT and handed back. The finding was flagged four times and surfaced zero times; a human caught it in the PR thread.
- **The fix (structural, not heading-matched):** `claude finished` — the ACTION-generated stable header — is now part of `CLAUDE_BODY_SIGNATURES`. Never key the task shape on its model-generated heading (it varies run to run). Regression fixture: `tests/fixtures/claude/task-shape-retrigger/` (clean summary + task-shape finding on one SHA must enumerate `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=2`).
- **Interaction with § progress comments (2026-06-11):** the WIP checklist comment ALSO carries the "Claude finished" header only when done — while working it lacks that header and has unchecked `- [ ]` items. The not-a-verdict markers there are unchanged; a completed task-shape body (header present, boxes checked) is a verdict, a WIP one is RUNNING.
- **Window caveat.** Pass 2b's SHA window is derived from `claude-code-review.yml` runs only. A task-shape response on a PR whose head SHA never ran that workflow (mention-only usage) has no window → UNPROVEN → the fallback surfaces the newest summary as material and the judge is forbidden CLEAN — fail-closed, acceptable. Widening the window source to `claude.yml` runs is deliberately NOT done (that workflow answers arbitrary @-mentions, not just reviews).

## § calibration update — a SECOND refusal shape ("already left multiple review comments"), and the question-shaped mention that gets past it (downstream, 2026-08-10)

§ A7 documents the `code-review` plugin's `Skipping review — Claude has already posted a code review comment` no-op and states that an explicit `@claude review` **overrides the skip**. A downstream install produced a **different, harder refusal**, and the documented override was not what broke it.

- **The shape.** The summary body read: `## Code review` / *"No new review performed — claude[bot] has already left multiple review comments on this PR (most recently on <date>). Please address those existing findings before requesting another review."* This is a **refusal with a reason**, not the terse skip no-op — different wording, so a `CLAUDE_NOOP_PATTERNS` list keyed only on `Skipping review` will classify it as a substantive verdict. It is not one: it contains no findings and no clean judgement.
- **It survived the push auto-run.** Four consecutive `pull_request` runs across four different head SHAs all completed `success` while the *same* refusal comment (one fixed comment id, unchanged timestamp) remained the newest summary. `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=0` throughout. This is the §Review-state case where **a green check carries strictly zero review information** — the Actions conclusion tracked the workflow running, not a review happening.
- **The refusal is sticky across SHAs.** It keyed off "has already commented on this PR", not on the diff, so pushing fixes could not clear it. Retriggering per § A7 is the documented answer, but on this install the *review-shaped* mention is what the plugin was refusing.
- **What worked: a question-shaped mention that never says "review".** A plain `@claude` comment that (a) **names the specific files** changed since the last pass, (b) asks **numbered, concrete questions** about them, and (c) **avoids the word "review"** was answered by `claude.yml` in the task shape (§ the @-mention TASK SHAPE) with a full substantive pass — three times in a row, each returning a real, distinct, actionable finding. The phrasing matters: the refusal appears to trigger on being asked for *a review*; being asked *a question about named files* is a different request.
- **Adapter/orchestrator rules this implies:**
  - Add refusal wording to the no-op set **by intent, not by exact string** — a summary that declines to review and contains neither findings nor a clean judgement is a no-op regardless of how it phrases it. `no new review performed` and `already left multiple review comments` are the observed second variant; expect more.
  - **Never infer a verdict from the Actions conclusion.** Four `success` runs and zero verdicts co-existed here for over an hour.
  - When the engine refuses repeatedly, the escalation is **narrow and specific**, not louder: name files, ask numbered questions, drop the word "review". A generic re-ping re-triggers the same refusal.
- **Cost note.** Each question-shaped mention produced a genuinely different finding rather than a re-run of the first — including one that only appeared *after* the previous round's fix (the defect had moved one layer up rather than being eliminated). Treat "the engine already reviewed this PR" as false whenever the diff has changed materially; the refusal is a plugin heuristic, not a statement about coverage.

## § calibration update — skip-vs-no-skip is install-STABLE: measure it once, then budget for it (mind-vault self-install, 2026-08-21)

> **Qualified by § install-stability has a counterexample (same day, third downstream): one install showed all three behaviors on a
> single PR within hours.** Read that section before treating a probe result as durable — the
> stability below held across four PRs *on this install*, which makes it a prior, not a guarantee.

§ dual substantive verdicts established that the skip-no-op is install-dependent and left *why* unresolved, which leaves an
orchestrator treating each push as a coin flip. Within a single install it is not variable at all.

- **The measurement.** Four consecutive mind-vault PRs (#236 across two head SHAs, #237, #238) — every
  post-first-review push `synchronize` auto-run completed `success` with `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=0`. Six
  of six. No push after a PR's first review has ever produced a verdict on this install.
- **The reframe.** Skip-vs-no-skip is a property **of the install**, determinable in one observation and
  stable thereafter — not per-push nondeterminism. That section's install still never skips; this one always
  does. Both are consistent *with themselves*, which is the useful part: you can plan around your own.
- **Determine your install's class cheaply.** On the first PR after any workflow or plugin-version
  change, push a trivial commit *after* the first review has posted and read `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS` for
  the new SHA. `0` ⇒ skip-install: the explicit retrigger is the only verdict source, every cycle. `≥1`
  ⇒ non-skip install: § dual substantive verdicts's masking rule governs, because push + retrigger now yield two
  substantive verdicts per SHA that can disagree. Re-probe after workflow/plugin changes — § dual substantive verdicts's
  candidate variables are exactly version and config skew, so the class is not permanent.
- **Operational consequence on a skip-install.** The Phase-3 explicit retrigger is a **routine per-cycle
  cost to budget**, not an exception path. A loop that treats it as exceptional spends a full Phase-4
  wait per cycle rediscovering that the green check is empty. (Whether the retrigger can safely fire
  immediately on push — skipping the wait for a run known to be useless — is **untested**; it would
  double-run against § A7's double-run-friction case, so the measured-safe order stays: wait for DONE, observe zero
  verdicts, then retrigger.)
- **The fail-closed gate is load-bearing here, not a backstop.** `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN=false` fired
  on **every one** of those six cycles. On a skip-install it is the primary mechanism standing between a
  green `claude-review` check and a false CLEAN — each of those six would have handed back clean under
  an adapter that read the Actions conclusion or the newest stale summary. Anything that weakens the
  gate to reduce "noise" is removing the only thing working on this class of install.

## § calibration update — install-stability has a counterexample; fence your verdict watchers (third downstream, 2026-08-21)

A same-day observation from a *third* downstream install challenges the §above "stable
thereafter" reframe: **one install exhibited all three behaviors on a single PR within
hours** — (a) two substantive verdicts on one SHA ~3 minutes apart that DISAGREED (clean
first, then 3 findings — the § dual substantive verdicts masking case, live), (b) a commented "Skipped — already
reviewed" no-op on a later push, then (c) a **silent skip**: `claude-review` check
`completed`/`success` with **no comment posted at all** on a yet-later push. The class
probe is still worth running, but treat its answer as a prior, not a guarantee — the same
install can drift between classes within a day (suspected variables: how many reviews
already exist on the PR, and whether a ready-for-review transition and a push race their
auto-runs). The plannable invariants are unchanged and carried the whole incident:
enumerate **every** substantive head-SHA verdict (the clean-first verdict alone would have
shipped 3 findings); after a fix push, **verdict-or-retrigger** — if no fresh verdict lands
for the new SHA, fire the explicit retrigger regardless of what the check conclusion says
(the silent skip's green check is exactly the false-CLEAN shape the fail-closed gate
exists for).

**Fence your verdict watchers (orchestrator-side).** Two watcher failures in that same
loop came from polling `comments[-1]` / grepping the finder's tail: the poll matched a
**stale pre-fix verdict** and reported it as the fix's result — twice. A verdict watcher
must carry a **timestamp fence**: record `T0` when the fix push (or retrigger) fires and
accept only material **newer than `T0`** *and* carrying verdict shape (the "finished/Code
review" body, not the in-progress checklist — whose header text also varies between the
auto and @-mention paths, so match on completion markers, not on "Review in progress").
**Newer means `max(created_at, updated_at) > T0`, never `created_at` alone.** The action
can post a progress comment at run start and **edit it in place** into the final verdict
— `created_at` then predates the fix while the verdict is genuinely fresh, so a
created_at-only fence rejects a verdict that did land. That is the mirror failure of the
stale read this paragraph opens with, and it is the cheaper one: it costs a needless
retrigger, not a wrong answer. Fence both directions.
Latest-comment matching without a fence re-reads history as news; § slow-not-hung's re-fetch
discipline protects against *late* verdicts, the fence protects against *old* ones.
