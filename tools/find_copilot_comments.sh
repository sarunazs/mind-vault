# Find GitHub Copilot review activity on a PR — inline comments, top-level PR
# comments, and reviews.
# Used by the /copilot-loop skill (mind-vault) as well as human inspection.
#
# Bot user.login dual identity — confirmed empirically on mind-vault PR
# #118 (2026-05-17 cycle 2): GitHub Copilot's PR-review bot exposes
# DIFFERENT user.login values across endpoints:
#   - /pulls/<N>/reviews          → 'copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]'
#   - /pulls/<N>/comments         → 'Copilot'
#   - /pulls/<N>/requested_reviewers → 'Copilot'
# This is GitHub-side, not a script bug — the bracket-bot form on /reviews
# and the bare 'Copilot' on /comments are the actual API responses. The
# filter below matches both spellings to catch every endpoint's authored
# entries. The check-run app-slug filter ('copilot' substring match) is
# still best-guess — calibrate when the first check-run-bearing PR runs
# through. If a future Copilot product change adds a third spelling,
# extend the tuple below + AGENT_copilot.md + commands/copilot-loop.md.
#
# Output contract:
#   - Prints a single `COPILOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL=<id> COMMIT=<sha> AT=<iso-timestamp>` line
#     on its own when copilot's most recent review on the PR is a clean-signal
#     ("found no new issues" OR "generated no new comments" — both phrasings observed
#     in the wild as of 2026-05-22). The loop's Phase 4 decision tree greps for
#     this line.
#     The signal source is /pulls/<N>/reviews PRIMARILY, with a /commits/<sha>/check-runs
#     fallback (added 2026-05-06): copilot can post the clean signal as a GitHub Check
#     instead of a review-body — the script synthesizes COPILOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL from a
#     successful check-run when /reviews has no clean-signal review for HEAD.
#   - Prints formatted inline findings (existing behaviour, unchanged).
#   - Prints any top-level PR comments from copilot (umbrella summaries, retrigger
#     acknowledgements, etc.) so the loop can detect truly-new activity by id.
#   - Never early-exits before all four endpoints have been polled — a clean-signal
#     review and fresh inline findings can coexist for the same commit if copilot was
#     re-triggered after a prior clean.

# Pass 1 — Reviews: three Python sub-passes against $REVIEWS
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Three near-identical python3 blocks below all parse $REVIEWS, filter for
# Copilot, and sort by submitted_at — but each answers a different question
# and emits a different marker:
#
#   1. CLEAN_SIGNAL_LINE   — "is copilot saying HEAD is clean right now?"
#                            Emits COPILOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL only on positive match.
#                            Empty otherwise. Drives /copilot-loop's Phase 4
#                            fast-path hand-back.
#
#   2. LATEST_REVIEW_LINE  — "what is the most recent copilot review, regardless
#                            of clean state?" Emits COPILOT_LATEST_REVIEW
#                            unconditionally with a CLEAN=true|false flag.
#                            Drives the active/stale finding filter from PR #81.
#
#   3. OTHER_REVIEWS       — "what non-clean reviews against earlier SHAs are
#                            still in history?" Emits a small human-readable
#                            list (capped at 5).
#
# Copilot PR #81 review (3156265252, LOW) flagged the duplication as a
# maintenance smell — same filter + sort + field-extract in three places.
# Kept three blocks intentionally:
#
#   - Each block answers ONE question and is independently readable (~15 lines
#     vs ~40 for a consolidated emit-three-markers block).
#   - The line-by-line stdout shape (independently empty-able markers in their
#     existing order) IS a contract — `/copilot-loop` Phase 4 greps the
#     `^COPILOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL=` anchor; consolidating risks reordering or
#     emitting empty placeholders that subtly change consumer behaviour.
#   - Three python3 spawns is ~150ms total — invisible at the loop's 270s
#     polling cadence. Performance is not the load-bearing argument here.
#
# Drift risk: if Copilot becomes a different bot login or the API field
# names change, all THREE blocks need updating. Worth consolidating IF a fourth
# marker is added or the maintenance pain actually shows up.
