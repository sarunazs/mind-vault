# IDEA-023: Cross-project idea namespacing — attribute foreign ideas as IDEA-NNN:project

**Status**: ✅ Complete (2026-08-14)
**Priority**: Medium

**Problem** (or opportunity): Every project keeps an independent `IDEA-NNN` stream, so bare idea numbers collide the moment two projects appear in one conversation, doc, or memory note. Live incident (2026-08-14): a mind-vault session answered a "where were we" question by citing another project's IDEAs with bare numbers — mind-vault has its own IDEA-016/017 and that project an unrelated IDEA-016/017 — and the user could not tell which repo the session was even on. The `/idea` skill already carries a defensive rule born of the same ambiguity ("never carry a number from another project's stream"), and memory notes routinely write disambiguators by hand (`(project-x) IDEA-178`, `project-x IDEA-112`).

**Proposal** (or idea): Adopt a single attribution convention for foreign-project idea references: `IDEA-NNN:project` (e.g. `IDEA-NNN:project-x` — examples here use non-digit `NNN` deliberately, so they sit outside the detector regex), where `project` is the repo's own name, never an alias. Bare `IDEA-NNN` always means *the current project's* stream. Wire the convention into the write-sites that produce cross-project references:

- `/idea` + `/compound` + `/wrap` skill prose and the cross-idea-amendments rule — a one-liner each where they touch foreign idea refs (catchment-style, per the PR #227 wired-pointer convention). `/plan` carries no such prose site — plans that cite a foreign idea inherit the grammar from the reference via `/idea` § 4, so no `/plan` wire exists (reconciled at review time; the as-shipped set is the reference's `Wired:` list).
- Auto-memory guidance — memory notes spanning projects use the suffix instead of ad-hoc "(project) IDEA-N" prose.
- Session/report prose — when an agent cites an idea from a repo other than the session's working repo, the suffix is mandatory.
- Scrub-gate synergy: a namespaced ref self-identifies as foreign, making the `/compound` scrub classification mechanical — a non-placeholder suffix in a staged mind-vault diff is a violation by construction, whereas a bare foreign number needs context to classify.

**Why now**:
- The ambiguity produced a real repo-context mix-up in a live session; the cost is confusion at exactly the moments (multi-repo estates, cross-project compounds, harvest ledgers) the workflow is designed for.
- Multi-repo estates (one active consumer estate spans ~30 repos, several with their own idea streams, each numbering independently) multiply the collision surface.

**Non-goals**:
- No renumbering of any existing stream, and no global registry — numbering stays per-project and append-only.
- No frontmatter schema change in this idea's first cut: `related`/`depends_on`/`supersedes` stay same-project bare ids. (Invalidating condition: if a real cross-project dependency ever needs to be machine-readable in frontmatter — e.g. sprint-auto sequencing across repos — that becomes its own follow-up idea, not a silent extension of this one.)
- No retro-editing of merged docs/archives; the convention applies forward from adoption.

**Related**: The `/idea` skill's "each project's numbering is independent" rule (SKILL.md § 4) is the defensive half of this problem; this idea adds the attribution half. The `/compound` scrub gate (compound SKILL.md step 5) treats foreign IDEA refs as scrub candidates — namespaced refs make that classification mechanical.
