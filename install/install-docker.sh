#!/bin/bash
# Description: Install Docker Engine + Compose plugin on a fresh Debian/Ubuntu host
# Usage: sudo ./install/install-docker.sh [--check] [--no-group] [--no-test-run]
# Supports: Debian 12+ (bookworm, trixie), Ubuntu 22.04+ (jammy, noble, etc.)
#
# Why: mind-vault's RULE_parallel-worktree-docker and the sprint-auto / deployment
# workflows assume Docker Engine + the `docker compose` plugin (v2) are installed
# on the host. Fresh VPS images usually ship without them, and the distro-packaged
# `docker.io` is often too old for the docker-compose-v2 `!override` syntax the
# parallel-worktree pattern depends on. This script installs directly from Docker's
# official apt repo — the production-grade path, not the get.docker.com curl-sh
# convenience script — so the install is auditable and repeatable.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Idempotency check: exit early if docker + compose plugin already work.
#   2. OS detection via /etc/os-release — refuses anything other than debian/ubuntu.
#   3. Removes any distro-packaged docker.io / containerd / runc / podman-docker that
#      would conflict with the official packages.
#   4. Installs Docker's apt signing key + repo for the detected distro + codename.
#   5. Installs docker-ce, docker-ce-cli, containerd.io, docker-buildx-plugin,
#      docker-compose-plugin.
#   6. Adds the invoking user ($SUDO_USER) to the docker group so rootless `docker`
#      commands work after a re-login. Skip with --no-group.
#   7. Runs `docker run --rm hello-world` as a smoke test. Skip with --no-test-run.
#
# Flags:
#   --check          Report current install state and exit. No writes.
#   --no-group       Don't touch the docker group. Useful when the target user is
#                    managed externally (LDAP, Ansible, etc.).
#   --no-test-run    Skip the hello-world smoke test. Faster; useful in CI.
