# Description: Install + configure mosh and tmux for resilient SSH sessions on Debian/Ubuntu
# Usage: sudo ./install/install-mosh-tmux.sh [flags]
# Supports: Debian 11+ (bullseye, bookworm, trixie), Ubuntu 20.04+ (focal, jammy, noble, etc.)
#
# Why: Spotty networks + long-running Claude Code / CLI sessions = constant
# context loss on SSH drops. The fix is a two-layer combo:
#
#   * tmux keeps the shell session alive on the server across disconnects;
#     attach / detach cycles survive any network event.
#   * mosh replaces raw SSH for the *connection* layer — handles 30-min
#     disconnects, roaming networks, laptop sleep, cell handoff, all
#     gracefully. UDP-based, reconnects without dropping the session.
#
# Together: laptop wakes up an hour later, mosh transparently reconnects
# to its existing UDP server, tmux is still running the same pane with
# Claude mid-thought. Zero context loss.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Idempotency: installed packages + marked rc / conf blocks are detected
#      and re-affirmed, not duplicated. Safe to re-run.
#   2. Installs `mosh` and `tmux` via apt.
#   3. Writes `~/.tmux.conf` inside BEGIN/END markers so manual tuning
#      outside those markers survives re-runs.
#   4. Adds an SSH-only auto-attach snippet to `~/.bashrc` (also
#      marker-bounded) so every SSH/mosh login drops straight into tmux.
#   5. If ufw is active, opens UDP 60000:61000 (mosh's default port range).
#   6. Prints a client-side reminder (mosh needs a mosh-client on the
#      laptop end too).
#
# Flags:
#   --check                Report current install + config state, exit. No writes.
#   --session-name NAME    tmux session to auto-attach/create (default: main)
#   --no-ufw               Don't touch ufw (skip the 60000:61000/udp rule).
#   --no-autoattach        Install + write tmux.conf, but skip the .bashrc edit.
#   --no-tmux-config       Install packages + handle autoattach/ufw, but skip tmux.conf.
#   --target-user USER     User whose ~/.bashrc + ~/.tmux.conf to edit.
#                          Default: $SUDO_USER (the invoking user under sudo).
#   -h, --help             Show this header and exit.
