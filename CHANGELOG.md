# Changelog

All notable changes to mind-vault — skills, rules, agents, commands, tools.

Mind-vault is a rolling config library. Entries are grouped by month, reverse-chronological within each month, and each entry carries a provenance marker — a date and/or the PR link — on the bullet for rolling month-grouped entries, or on the version-section's intro paragraph for a single-PR version section (where every bullet shares one PR, repeating the marker per bullet is noise). From v4 onward, major architectural milestones get an explicit version header (v4.0.1 introduced multi-engine review and was the first open-source release); month groupings continue to roll forward inside each version. Older than the first entry: the `git log` is authoritative.

Category keys follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/): **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, **Removed**, **Deprecated**, **Security**.

## Unreleased

_(none)_

## v5.8.4 — the store that was never created and the login that never failed loudly

One consuming ExtJS project's day, traced from a single symptom ("the dialog shows an error toast
instead of opening"): four defect classes across the component layer and the toolchain, plus the
git-hygiene guardrail the same walk turned up — compounded 2026-09-01.

### Added

- **extjs-frontend / MODERN_COMPONENT_FOOTGUNS §23** — the VM-store silent-null family: a
  store whose config binds an undeclared data key is never created at all (null forever, no
  error); even declared ones are null in the construction window (null-guard manual loads —
  the store autoLoads once its binds publish); and never wrap a dialog open in a promise
  chain whose `.catch` does HTTP-error recovery — a render throw then masquerades as backend
  state. Pin recipe included.
- **extjs-frontend / SENCHA_TOOLCHAIN_AND_BUILD §8** — cross-origin dev login is dead in
  modern Chrome (`SameSite=Lax` cookie dropped on cross-site XHR + `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
  invalid with credentials → silent bounce-to-login): the fix is an opt-in dev-server proxy
  mirroring production's nginx (pinned Host, cookieDomainRewrite, same-origin code path).
- **extjs-frontend / SENCHA_TOOLCHAIN_AND_BUILD §9** — one `sencha app watch` profile at a
  time (shared `generatedFiles/`, last writer wins) and the microloader picks the manifest by
  UA, not by what the dev server built; DevTools emulation lever + the CDP-input-wedge
  fallback (drive via the framework controller API).
- **RULE_git-safety** — "a path in `.gitignore` proves nothing": tracked-before-the-rule
  files keep carrying diffs (and, observed, a config value on the trunk everyone believed
  was ignored); probe `git ls-files --error-unmatch`, fix `git rm --cached`, announce the
  pull-side effect.
- **extjs-frontend / SENCHA_TOOLCHAIN_AND_BUILD §10** — post-deploy, the OLD app runs
  first: the microloader boots from its `localStorage` manifest cache and only then finds
  the new build — via a browser-NATIVE "updated, reload?" confirm that freezes the renderer
  (CDP timeouts) until a human dismisses it. Verify a deploy against the server artifact
  (manifest stamp + symbol grep in the served `app.js`), never against a booted tab.
  (The same walk also live-validated RULE_git-safety's push-the-remote-ref section: a
  `master:staging` promote of a stale local master reported "Everything up-to-date" while
  staging stayed one release behind — the documented `origin/<branch>:target` form fixed it.)

## v5.8.3 — the detection that terminated in a flag nobody read

A copilot review whose visible inline set was empty carried three real findings in its body's
suppressed-comments block. The adapter had detected the block since v5.6.1 — but detection only
withheld the clean signal and set a legacy `CLEAN=` token the orchestrator is explicitly told to
ignore, so the loop counted zero findings and read CLEAN. The findings were caught by a hand-run
`gh api` on the review body, not by the loop — compounded 2026-08-28.

### Added

- `tools/find_copilot_comments.sh` — emits `COPILOT_SUPPRESSED=<n> REVIEW=<id> COMMIT=<sha>
  AT=<ts>` plus the suppressed items verbatim (each carries `file:line` + text, so they are as
  structured as an inline finding — they just arrive in the review body).
- `tests/test_copilot_clean_detection.sh` § (b) — asserts the marker, the surfaced items, that the
  review-stats list is not swallowed by the extractor, and that clean fixtures emit no marker. All
  proven red against the pre-fix adapter first.

### Fixed

- `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` § Per-engine fetch — suppressed findings now COUNT toward the
  active-finding total, so an engine that surfaced them is never clean. The new marker is
  authoritative, unlike the legacy `CLEAN=` token beside it; the dual-signal output shape carries
  the suppressed count.
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md` — registers `<ENGINE>_SUPPRESSED` and
  states the rule an adapter has to follow: route a withheld-findings signal into the count, never
  into a second flag.

### Changed

- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-copilot.md` § Suppressed comments — second reversal on this
  section, corrected in place: detection was not delivery. The general lesson recorded with it —
  when an adapter learns something the verdict machinery is told to ignore, that is not a
  mitigation. The completeness caveat and the human-glance hand-back line still stand.

## v5.8.2 — gate the image you ship, encode where the string lands, probe the contract before the UI

One consuming ExtJS project's week: a CI gate that builds the release image and runs the suite
against it (the toolchain that actually works), a stored-XSS sink closed with a three-context
encoding model, and a paginator that was NOT shipped because one `limit=5` request showed the
backend ignores paging — compounded 2026-08-28.

### Added

- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/SENCHA_TOOLCHAIN_AND_BUILD.md` §7 — the CI gate on the release
  image: build the production Dockerfile in Actions (npm cripples Sencha Cmd; the Dockerfile is the
  one working toolchain), run it with a *resolvable* backend host, verify the static contract, run
  Playwright in a static mode on both bundles; same-repo/dispatch/push guard, never cancel a trunk
  run, warm ≈7 s with `tests/` dockerignored.
- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/PLAYWRIGHT_COMPONENTQUERY_E2E.md` §10 — boot probes on the
  production bundle: the launch chain catches its own rejection, so `pageerror` alone is vacuous —
  add console + failed-response collectors, a tolerated-404 whitelist with reasons, and tolerate a
  framework's bare-`undefined` rejection by shape only; prove the probe with a deliberate red.
- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/MODERN_COMPONENT_FOOTGUNS.md` §21–22 — encode at the sink in
  three contexts (html/attribute, JS string inside an inline handler, lossless DOM-id round-trip)
  plus a style allowlist, pinned benign-first and red-proven; and the rule that the second
  hand-copied framework guard is an `overrides/` file (the `Ext.form.Panel` Enter guard with an
  opt-in `enterAction`).
- `skills/plan/references/PRODUCTION_PATH_VERIFICATION.md` § The backend contract is an axis too —
  a UI that depends on paging/sorting/a status field names its discriminating request and plans
  the negative branch; `agents/AGENT_architect.md` PASS 5 gets the matching probe.
- `skills/deployment/references/CICD.md` § Path filters for image-building workflows —
  `paths-ignore` for docs-only changes, with the two checks that make it safe (no build inputs on
  the list; not a required status check).

### Changed

- `skills/extjs-frontend/SKILL.md`, `skills/deployment/SKILL.md`, `skills/plan/SKILL.md` —
  reference one-liners extended for the sections above.

## v5.8.1 — the record the class threw away, the formula that never ran, and the tap that sent

Three fixes on one consuming project's dialog, each "shipped" once before it actually worked,
and one browser-pilot slip — compounded 2026-08-27. The common thread: verify on the rendered
thing, not on the artifact that should have produced it.

### Added

- `skills/work/references/LIVE_PILOT_VERIFICATION.md` — four rules for verifying a change by
  driving a deployed UI: never tap a side-effecting action on data you don't own (confirm the
  code path first — a "preview" tap on a live templated record sent a real email); verify
  styling on the rendered element, not on the CSS being present; inject → measure → iterate to
  zero → port for parity work; wrap the factory to capture what a controller actually passes.
- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/MODERN_COMPONENT_FOOTGUNS.md` §18–20 — `Ext.Component#applyRecord`
  nulls any non-Model `record`; a view-model formula with an optional ancestor dependency never
  runs; desktop `Ext.field.Date` takes its ui from `floatedPicker`, an empty field pre-selects
  today, and the base theme's selected cell is `$base-color`-on-white.

### Changed

- The `/work` dispatch matrix and the `backend` / `frontend` / `curator` persona
  descriptions were written in Django's vocabulary while the stack layer had already gone
  plural (django / laravel / node / extjs resolve in `persona-dispatch.md`, and every
  persona body resolves its mechanics against the active skill). The matrix row an ExtJS
  plan item had to match read "Templates, Alpine, HTMX, Bulma", and the frontmatter
  `description:` that decides persona selection said "Django client-side work" — so the
  stack-agnostic personas were advertised as single-stack. Rows and descriptions now name
  the **concern**; the per-stack token mapping moved to `persona-dispatch.md` §
  "Domain vocabulary per stack", beside the auto-detection that resolves the active stack.
- `LIVE_PILOT_VERIFICATION.md` rules 2 and 4 stated their originating incident instead of
  their mechanism, in a framework-agnostic reference — "the field's picker took its ui from
  a different config key" names no field and no key, and rule 4's "here: the class dropped
  it" pointed at an incident the file never told. Rule 2 now states the generic failure (a
  shipped CSS rule still has to MATCH the element, then WIN against every rule that matches
  it — both DOM facts, so grepping the bundle proves nothing) with an ordered probe; rule 4
  names the two hypotheses its factory-wrap separates. Framework-specific causes live once,
  in the ExtJS footguns, cited by greppable label.

## v5.8.0 — silence read as success: decayed alerts, a green check with no verdict, and the gates that could not tell

Two compound streams landed on the same failure, so they ship as one release. An alert that breaks
loudly is a nuisance; an alert that stops being *able* to detect its subject keeps evaluating,
reports nothing, and its silence is indistinguishable from good news. Four independent instances
turned up in one operational stretch — none found by an alert firing, all four found by someone
checking whether it still could.

The same shape kept turning up in the tooling built to guard against it. The automated-review gate
reported a review finished and clean while it was still running. A different install's review check
completed green having posted no verdict at all. And a verdict watcher matching the latest comment
re-read a pre-fix verdict as the fix's result. Each one answered a question it had lost the ability
to answer, and each answer read as good news.
(2026-08-21 – 2026-08-25, [#240](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/240) + [#241](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/241))

### Added

- `skills/deployment/references/ALERT_SILENT_DECAY.md` — the four failures, each with the worked
  case that surfaced it. **A metric can change meaning without changing its name**, and that is far
  worse than a rename: a rename breaks the rule loudly, a meaning change leaves it producing a wrong
  answer. Carries the protocol for both sides — producers emit a new name for the new meaning and
  call it a MINOR, consumers grep their rule files on every producer upgrade. **A rule keyed on a
  conditionally-emitted series has no denominator**, so it silently covers fewer subjects than it
  appears to; the guard belongs at total absence, never per subject, because a per-subject version
  fires for weeks against a correct system and gets muted. **Suppression windows are pinned to a
  schedule someone else owns**, so they degrade silently and in the noisy direction — with the
  measured case where 30 of 64 episodes escaped windows that looked correct by inspection, and the
  rule that the one outlier left un-suppressed was the only real signal in the sample. And **rule
  state is not delivery**: the rule engine's own alert series says nothing about what a human
  received, which is why one gap sat unnoticed from the day it was introduced.

### Changed

- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` gains the counterexample to the install-stability
  reframe: one PR produced two disagreeing verdicts on one SHA, then a commented skip, then a
  **silent** skip — green check, no comment at all. The prior section now carries a forward qualifier
  so its confident reading cannot be taken alone. What survived the incident is what was already
  written down: enumerate every head-SHA verdict, and after a fix push take a fresh verdict or fire
  the retrigger, whatever the check conclusion says. New alongside it, the **watcher timestamp
  fence** — an ad-hoc poll that matches the latest comment re-reads a pre-fix verdict as the fix's
  result, which happened twice in one loop. Record `T0` at the push and accept only material newer
  than it. (The shipped adapter already window-fences; this is for orchestrator-side watchers.)

- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` gains three calibration blocks from a live loop.
  **The review-state check could report finished-and-green while the review was still running** — it
  looks for jobs belonging to one workflow whose commit matches the branch under review, and a
  manually retriggered review matches neither: it runs under a different workflow, and that kind of
  job reports the main branch as its commit. Fixing only the workflow name would not have helped.
  The reliable link is the one the platform already prints — every comment the reviewer posts links
  the job writing it — so the ids are read out of the comments and any job still running holds the
  whole check as running; an unreadable job counts as unfinished, never as finished. Also recorded:
  the reviewer's comment passes through **three** different bodies before it is a verdict, and the
  first has no checkboxes at all, so a watcher waiting for checkboxes to clear reports success in
  seconds against a review that has not begun. And **a pull request opened in an earlier session may
  already carry a review nobody read** — one here had sat four hours with three real findings while
  being described as "awaiting merge".

- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` also gains a citation convention, written
  because combining the two streams above broke six of its own cross-references. Sections were
  cited by line number, so appending a section shifted every line below it and the citations
  resolved to unrelated bullets — while still reading like working references. Nothing failed; a
  hand-check caught it. That prompted the full sweep and the guard recorded under **Fixed** below.
  Same class as the decayed alerts and the green-but-blind gate this release is about.
- `skills/review-loop/references/common-review-findings.md` gains two entries. **A review finding can
  be right about the smell and wrong about the direction**: one flagged a number that disagreed with
  every other copy in the repo and advised matching the majority — measuring the live system showed
  the majority was the stale one, and following the advice would have reinstalled a fact that stopped
  being true two months earlier. A disagreement between documents is never settled by counting
  documents. And **a decimal value wearing a binary unit label** — the two answers differ by about
  two percent, which is exactly small enough to survive every eyeball check.
- `rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md` gains a **reversal sweep**. Closing a gap is a correction
  like any other, but it does not feel like one, so nobody greps for the old claim. Measured: four
  days after a backup gap was closed, two live guides still described it as open — including, under
  a red heading as the first named problem, the page someone reads while the system is broken. That
  is the worst carrier: it sends a reader mid-incident to build something that already exists. The
  rule names the search order, starting with guides and HTML because those are read under pressure
  and least likely to be open when the fact changes, and it says to keep the half that is still true
  rather than deleting the warning outright.

- `rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md` gains an **anchor sweep**: editing a document by replacing a
  landmark heading with new text deletes that heading unless the replacement re-emits it. The body
  survives and reads as a continuation of whatever was inserted, the page renders perfectly, and
  nothing complains — found in this very PR by review, not by the sweep that was supposed to catch it.
  Carries the mechanical check: compare the set of headings before and after, rather than reading the
  diff, because the deleted line sits at the top of a large block of additions.
- `rules/RULE_git-safety.md` gains the stale-local-ref push hazard, placed beside the stacked-PR
  entry it shares mechanics with. `git fetch` updates remote-tracking refs and does not fast-forward
  local branches, so promoting a deploy pointer from a bare local branch name pushes whatever that
  branch was when you last checked it out. The failure is silent and reads as success — when the
  stale ref happens to equal the target, git reports `Everything up-to-date` and exits 0, and the
  next step deploys the previous release, also reporting success. Names the same hazard in
  `checkout -b`, the three-way `rev-parse` check for when a push reports no movement you expected,
  and the note that a string-level guard on this rule will match the documentation of it.

- `skills/shell/references/STRICT_MODE_HAZARDS.md` gains items 12 and 13, both about the gap
  `set -euo pipefail` does not cover. **A query that succeeds and prints nothing** poisons every
  command substitution downstream — `set -u` cannot help, because the variable is set, to empty —
  and the fix is a non-empty assertion on the assignment rather than the use. **A destructive target
  must be identified by a resolving test, not by its name**, because the failure mode of a wrong
  target is frequently creation rather than an error: point a provisioning tool at the wrong account
  and it builds a parallel copy of everything and exits 0. Includes the case where two accounts
  shared a display name, and the caution that the obvious anchor may not carry the identity at all.
  Item **14** closes the same loop one level down: **an assertion that
    cannot express "empty" asserts nothing.** Checking that output is empty by searching it for an
    empty string fails against empty input, so the case looks like a caught regression while testing
    nothing at all. Found while writing tests for a reports-green-when-it-should-not bug, which is the
    same defect one level down.

- `skills/plan/references/PRODUCTION_PATH_VERIFICATION.md` sharpens the artifact-set axis: when the
  runtime *selects* among variants — build profiles, device manifests, locale bundles — each variant
  is a delivery axis needing its own production-side probe. A device-split SPA built only the desktop
  profile and verified only the desktop manifest, so mobile had never booted across five deployments;
  the phone code was fully tested, the phone artifact never existed. The planning tell: a config
  listing several builds or targets whose deploy and verify steps name only one of them.

- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/MODERN_COMPONENT_FOOTGUNS.md` gains §17 — `ui:` names are
  unchecked strings, so an invented one renders a component with no styling at all. Grep the SCSS for
  the name before using it, copy the exact pair a sibling component uses, and put new-chrome
  visibility in the pilot smoke: no automated gate sees contrast.

### Fixed

- `tools/find_copilot_comments.sh` — copilot clean detection had gone **blind**, and the fallback
  it fell through to was reporting false CLEANs. Copilot's review body moved to an emoji-bucket
  header (`🟢 Approval recommended` / `🟡 Changes recommended` / `🔵 Needs a closer look`) with the
  count buried in a collapsed block as `Comments generated: 0 new`. Neither phrase the matcher
  looked for appears in any of them, so body-level detection stopped matching anything — and
  nothing complained, because the check-run synthesis quietly took over and kept answering. That
  fallback then papered a green check-run over a review carrying **two real findings**, because
  suppressed findings post no inline comment and the inline pre-check could not see them. Three
  fixes: the matcher carries all three phrasings; a body listing suppressed comments is never
  clean whatever its header says; and the check-run synthesis is gated on there being no review
  body at all — if a body exists it *is* the verdict. Found by reading review bodies by hand while
  running the loop on this PR. The file's own header had predicted it: "if Copilot becomes a
  different bot login or the API field names change, all THREE blocks need updating."
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` + `tests/test_reference_anchors.sh` — every
  line-number citation in the review-loop references is gone, replaced by a **greppable named
  anchor**: a phrase that is a literal substring of exactly one heading. The economics are what
  decide it — a grep costs CPU, a wrong line number costs a read of the wrong content plus the
  hunt after it, and the citation keeps *looking* correct either way. Each of the fifteen was
  resolved against the file as it stood in the commit that introduced it (`git log -S`, then read
  that revision) rather than guessed. Two findings from doing that: `§131 + §140` was already
  wrong in the commit that wrote it (the blocks it named were at 139 and 148), and
  `§Net-capability` had never matched anything — the file only ever said "Net engine capability".
  A new `test-anchors` target fails on any reintroduced `§NNN`, on a named anchor that stops
  matching its heading, and on a prose anchor whose definition site disappears.
- `tools/find_copilot_comments.sh` + `tests/test_copilot_clean_detection.sh` — the adapter gains a
  `COPILOT_FIXTURE_DIR` test seam mirroring the claude adapter's, and the clean/false-CLEAN paths
  gain coverage: emoji-bucket clean, suppressed-findings-are-never-clean, and legacy-phrasing
  back-compat. Both fixtures were checked against the pre-fix adapter first and **fail** there —
  the suppressed case emits `COPILOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL=checkrun-*`, which is the bug. The drift shipped
  silently because nothing exercised this path; now a format change fails a test instead of
  changing which code path answers. `make test` covers it via a new `test-copilot` target.
  The seam's offline promise is **enforced, not asserted**: one case runs the adapter against a
  `gh` that always fails. That was not idle — the seam left `gh repo view` unconditional, so the
  adapter died resolving the repo name before reaching any fixture, and the suite passed anyway
  because the machine running it had `gh` installed and authed. Repo identity is now resolved
  locally under the seam, mirroring the claude adapter.
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-copilot.md` — records the template drift and the synthesis
  gate, and **partly reverses** its own § Suppressed comments claim. That section said suppressed
  comments were absent from every API surface the adapter reads and that the adapter therefore
  could not be extended to fetch them; the new template renders them inside the review body, and
  the adapter now reads them. Corrected in place with the half that is still true kept — presence
  is detected, completeness is not certified, so the human-glance caveat stands. A worked instance
  of the reversal sweep added to `RULE_self-sweep-before-push` in this same release.

## v5.7.3 — the claude skip-no-op is install-stable, and a US-English pass

Four consecutive PRs on mind-vault's own install produced the same result: every push after a PR's
first review completed its check green having posted no verdict at all. That is not per-push
nondeterminism — it is a stable property of an install, which makes it something to measure once and
budget for rather than rediscover each cycle. (2026-08-21, [#239](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/239))

### Changed

- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` gains the install-stability calibration. The prior
  section established that the skip is install-dependent and left *why* unresolved, which leaves an
  orchestrator treating each push as a coin flip; within one install it does not vary. Carries the
  cheap probe for classifying your own install (push a trivial commit after the first review, read
  `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS`), when to re-probe, and the operational consequence: on a skip-install the
  explicit retrigger is a routine per-cycle cost, not an exception path. Also records that the
  `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN=false` fail-closed gate fired on six of six cycles — on this class of
  install it is the only thing between a green check and a false CLEAN, so weakening it to reduce
  noise removes the sole working mechanism.
- `rules/RULE_git-safety.md` gains a merge-strategy lean, placed above the stacked-PR hazard it
  shares mechanics with. **Explicitly a preference and never a blocker** — squash-merge stays
  acceptable and no merge is held over it. The lean toward merge commits is costed concretely:
  `git branch --merged main` cannot see a squash-merged branch (the tip is never an ancestor), so
  post-merge cleanup becomes a content-equivalence investigation — and a misleading one once `main`
  moves ahead, because the diff then reports older revisions of lines `main` has since improved.
  Ancestry checks false-alarm on every healthy squash-merged branch, and tooling accumulates
  workarounds. States what squash genuinely buys (a linear `main`, worth most where branches carry
  noisy WIP) and why that weighs less in a docs repo with no code to bisect and per-PR commits that
  already read well. Closes with the part that holds either way: confirm content landed before
  deleting a local branch.
- `skills/skill-writer/references/LANGUAGE_CONVENTIONS.md` (new) — the house register is now
  written down rather than inferred: **US-English spelling, metric/SI units, Celsius**. The two
  axes are independent and the pairing is deliberate — American spelling is the register technical
  writing is read in, metric is the system the work is done in. The spelling half is justified by
  the identifiers themselves (`serialize`, `initialize`, `color`, `behavior` are API names in every
  stack these skills cover, so UK prose puts two spellings of one word on a page). Carries the
  scope limits that matter more than the rule: never impose it on a consuming project's codebase,
  never rewrite released CHANGELOG sections or archived docs, and treat the repo's remaining
  pre-existing drift as a deliberate standalone sweep rather than a tail-end addition. Plus the
  `analysis`/`analyses` false positive, the check-for-code-identifiers caveat, the rule that a term
  quoted from an untouched file moves with that file rather than with the pointer that echoes it
  (with the grep-the-target step that keeps that exception from widening into a blanket one),
  and the ISO-date / 24-hour conventions already in force. Wired at both write-sites: the `skill-writer` References
  list, and `RULE_self-sweep-before-push`'s doc-consistency sweep as item (7).
- **US-English spelling pass across nine skill files** — `behaviour`→`behavior`,
  `serialise`→`serialize`, `organised`→`organized`, `honour`→`honor`, `favour`→`favor`,
  `flavour`→`flavor`, `normalise`→`normalize` in `deployment`, `extjs-frontend`, `laravel`, `plan`,
  `work` and `review-loop` (bodies and references) — the first application of the convention above. Prose only; no code identifiers touched, and historical
  CHANGELOG sections left as written. The repo still mixes US/UK elsewhere — this is the convention
  going forward, not a completed sweep.

## v5.7.2 — money-split session harvest: per-row preconditions, live-console ops, one-PR discipline

One day of billing-correctness work on a consuming project, harvested to two destinations. A
review refused a plan resting on a container-level flag where the enforcing server branched on a
per-row field — the premise was true of every row then present and still wrong, and shipping it
would have rebuilt the money bug it was written to fix. Beside it, the console-ops discipline
learned the hard way when an operator's pasted cleanup loop tripped an edge ban.
(2026-08-21, [#238](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/238))

### Changed

- `agents/AGENT_architect.md` PASS 5 gains the per-row-predicate bullet: phrase a
  precondition at the level of the mechanism that enforces it — a container-level flag can
  be TRUE for every row while the server branches on a per-row field, so mixed states
  silently take the other branch; and when later field evidence contradicts a pessimistic
  static-read claim, write the dated correction back. From a review that refuted a billing
  plan's "all rows virtual" premise before it shipped a wrong-money path.
- `rules/RULE_git-safety.md` gains the fold-into-one-PR default, placed directly above the
  existing stacked-PR hazard it prevents: if a PR for the work is open and unmerged, push the
  follow-up commit onto its branch instead of opening a second one, and never branch a new PR
  off an open PR's branch. Binds hardest on doc finalization, CHANGELOG/version fixes,
  review-driven fixes and sweeps — the work most likely to get its own PR by reflex. The cost
  is not merge count but conflicts on append-at-top shared files (`CHANGELOG.md`, the ideas
  index, the monthly devlog), which two open branches hit by construction and re-hit after
  every rebase. Carries the cases where a separate PR *is* right.
- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/MODERN_COMPONENT_FOOTGUNS.md` gains §16: console ops
  against a live app — `ComponentQuery [0]` is the first instance, not the active view
  (enumerate with `isVisible(true)`, derive ids from the picked view's own proxy state);
  destructive calls list-first and one at a time, never a pasted loop (the 13-request 4xx
  burst → edge fail2ban ban precedent).

## v5.7.1 — cross-box agent handoff via repo issues + a night's incident harvest

One evening on a consuming project produced one new pattern and four hard-won extensions — a
duplicate-record UX incident, a legacy-row validation wall, and a fail2ban ban of the operator's
own IP that took a whole e2e suite down with it (2026-08-20, [#237](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/237)).

### Added

- `skills/work/references/CROSS_BOX_ISSUE_HANDOFF.md` — when work surfaces a task for an agent
  on another machine, the target repo's GitHub issues are the channel: issue body = brief with
  asks, comments = append-only evidence chain, corrections posted rather than edited; the
  human's relay burden drops to one line. Pointer added to the work skill's References.

### Changed

- `skills/plan/references/DEFERRAL_EXPIRY_TRIGGERS.md` — new section: staged gates rot. A
  "backend-gated" phase was un-gated the same evening by reading the dependency's source (a
  pre-existing endpoint family served everything); re-probe gates from source before honoring
  them, and write gates as the missing *capability*, not the endpoint that lacks it.
- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/MODERN_COMPONENT_FOOTGUNS.md` — footgun #15: stay-open
  create dialogs must disarm Save (re-entry guard + mask + state-bound button + `saved` event);
  an unguarded dialog produced twelve duplicate records from repeated clicks.
- `skills/extjs-frontend/references/PLAYWRIGHT_COMPONENTQUERY_E2E.md` — §9: mock mode still
  fetches real external hosts (you are load on someone's box; a dead host fails suites that
  never mention it), and the known-green-commit re-run that splits code-vs-environment in one
  run.
- `skills/laravel/references/FORM_REQUESTS_RESOURCES.md` — update must not re-run the create
  gauntlet: validating `$model->toArray()` against create rules makes legacy rows unupdatable
  (even a state flip bounces); validate the request's fields, give state transitions their own
  rules.
- `skills/deployment/references/HARDENING.md` — fail2ban behind proxies: never act on
  forwarded-IP log lines (bans the end user while the proxy path stays open), never count
  application-level 4xx toward floods, audit ban lists for CDN/private-relay egress, monitor
  from an outside vantage.
- **References one-liners refreshed for all five extended/added references** —
  `deployment`, `laravel`, `plan`, and `extjs-frontend` (×2). The one-liner is the
  load-decision surface: a reference can gain a whole section and stay invisible to an agent
  scanning References, so extending a body means updating the line that advertises it.
- **CHANGELOG provenance markers backfilled** — v5.4.7, v5.4.8, v5.4.9 and v5.5.0 carried no
  PR link, and two of them still held the literal placeholder `([PR link in commit trail])`.
  All four now carry `(date, [#N](url))` per the preamble's convention.
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — 5.7.0 → 5.7.1, the mirror the version bump left behind.

## v5.7.0 — third frontend stack: `skills/extjs-frontend` (Sencha ExtJS 7 Modern)

A season of review and pilot-smoke findings on a consuming Sencha ExtJS 7.7 Modern SPA came down
to one theme: the Modern widgets do less than their names imply — an unchecked `checkbox`
serialises `null`, `formpanel` lets Enter reload the SPA, seeded models carry phantom ids, the
store `load` event delivers an Array. Around that sit a service layer that is a *precondition*
for any error UX, Jest and Playwright harnesses built for a framework that resists both, and a
toolchain whose production compile only the image build proves. All of it lifts into a stack
skill filling the four frontend contract headings — no persona edits, same as the Laravel proof.
(2026-08-18, [#236](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/236))

### Added

- **`skills/extjs-frontend/`** — `SKILL.md` (frontmatter trigger, stack resolution + fail-open,
  the four verbatim contract headings, a 14-row ✅/❌ matrix) + `VERSION` `7.7` (framework
  version, per the `django`/`laravel` convention) + seven
  load-on-demand references: `MODERN_COMPONENT_FOOTGUNS`, `SERVICE_LAYER`,
  `JEST_EXT_STUB_HARNESS`, `PLAYWRIGHT_COMPONENTQUERY_E2E`, `SENCHA_TOOLCHAIN_AND_BUILD`,
  `I18N_KEY_SWEEP`, `REFACTOR_CONTRACT_PINNING`. Body ≤ 250 lines; everything project-specific
  generalised (`App.*`, `<prefix>_*`, wrapper-field family, "entity dialog"). The frontmatter
  `description` and the `When to use` precondition both state the load gate positively **and**
  negatively — a Sencha marker must be present, and a plain Jest/Playwright/webpack toolchain is
  explicitly not one — so the skill stays dark in every repo that is not an ExtJS repo.

### Changed

- **`skills/work/references/persona-dispatch.md` — the `extjs` auto-detect row + precedence rule
  A3.** Frontend signal: `app.json` `"framework": "ext"` / `@sencha/ext*` / `Ext.define(` under
  `app/**`. Without A3 the skill would have been unreachable in practice: every ExtJS repo ships
  a `package.json`, which the `node` row already claimed as the frontend signal, so detection
  resolved `node` and never `extjs`. A3 makes a **named framework marker outrank the generic
  `package.json`**, which is now explicitly the fallback. **A3 is general, not an ExtJS
  carve-out** — it governs every repo carrying a named frontend marker *and* a
  `package.json` (a Laravel app with Vite/Tailwind, a Django app with a webpack build).
  A2 had only separated backend from frontend detection; two competing *frontend* signals
  had no rule at all until now. `extjs` is also the first
  **frontend-only** stack — it leaves `backend:` unresolved by design, and the pin convention
  gains the one-key form (`frontend: extjs-frontend`).
- **`skills/work/references/SKILL_CONTRACT.md` — the floor is per-side, and absence is a valid
  answer.** "MUST expose every required heading" read as all 10 for any stack skill; a
  frontend-only skill owes only the 4. Stated explicitly, along with the clause the SPA case
  forced: a heading may be filled with a **documented absence** — `extjs-frontend`'s
  *Partial/fragment response* records that an SPA returns JSON envelopes, never HTML fragments,
  and specifies the envelope contract in place of one. That is a filled heading; a placeholder
  is not. Stale "future laravel*" tiering diagram refreshed.
- **`README.md`** — skills table gains the `extjs-frontend` row; the slash-invocable list names it.
- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** — `extjs` keyword.

## v5.6.2 — plans must verify the production path, not just the dev-mode gate

A consuming SPA project's first real deployment surfaced six defect classes its always-green `unit + e2e` gate could not see — a production compile broken for weeks, a minifier-mangled property key at boot, a crippled fresh install the build plugin swallowed, raw translation keys the mocked API hid. One meta-cause: every axis on which the shipped artefact differs from what the gate exercises stayed unverified until the image was built and booted. (2026-08-17, [#235](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/235))

### Added

- **`skills/plan/references/PRODUCTION_PATH_VERIFICATION.md`** — the rule for plan authors: enumerate the axes on which production differs from the local gate (compiler/minifier mode, install, artefact set, configuration, data, delivery) and name a production-side check per axis. Where CI cannot run the production path, the manual gate becomes a named Verification step, not a nice-to-have.

### Changed

- **`agents/AGENT_architect.md` PASS 4** — new probe: which of the plan's Verification commands run against the artefact that will actually be deployed? Dev-mode-only gates on a project with a distinct production build/deploy path are a finding, with the missing check named per axis.
- **`skills/plan/SKILL.md`** — step 4's Verification bullet points at the new reference; References list gains the one-liner.

## v5.6.1 — copilot CLEAN covers only the comments the API shows

On the v5.6.0 PR the review loop converged clean over four cycles — copilot's final verdict said "generated no new comments" — while a suppressed copilot comment held a valid finding the whole time (a charset contradiction between the token prose and the wired regex). Suppressed comments exist only in the PR web UI; they appear on none of the API surfaces the adapter reads, and no API is known to expose them. The maintainer found it by expanding the suppressed set by hand. (2026-08-14, [#234](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/234))

### Added

- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-copilot.md` § Suppressed comments** — the incident, the mechanism (confidence-filter suppression, invisible to `/pulls/N/reviews` and `/pulls/N/comments`), and the mitigations: a standing hand-back caveat telling the human to expand suppressed comments in the UI before merging, user-relayed suppressed findings entering the fix batch as first-class input (verified against the tree first — suppression correlates with lower confidence), and an explicit instruction not to weaken the structural CLEAN verdict over a blind spot the adapter cannot close. Plus a row in the § Failure modes table.

### Changed

- **`skills/review-loop/SKILL.md`** — the final hand-back now carries the suppressed-comments caveat whenever copilot is in the engine set; the References one-liner surfaces the new section.

## v5.6.0 — cross-project idea namespacing: bare numbers are local, foreign refs carry the repo's name

Every project numbers its own `IDEA-NNN` stream, so bare numbers collide the moment two projects appear in one conversation or doc — a live session citing another repo's ideas from inside mind-vault made the repo context genuinely ambiguous (both repos have an unrelated IDEA-016/017). This release ships the attribution convention that ends it. Minor bump rather than the per-PR patch default: maintainer-selected per the adopter-magnitude rule — the convention changes how every consuming project writes cross-repo references. (2026-08-14, IDEA-023, [#233](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/233))

### Added

- **`skills/idea/references/CROSS_PROJECT_IDEA_REFS.md`** — the grammar: bare `IDEA-NNN` always means the repo the text lives in (or the session's working repo in prose); a foreign ref is written `IDEA-NNN:project`, where the token is the repo's own name, never an alias (`IDEA-NNN:mind-vault`, not `IDEA-NNN:mv`). Branch names are excluded — `:` is illegal in git refnames, and branches stay defended by the § 4 scan-from-disk rule. Frontmatter relationship lists stay same-project bare ids.
- **Scrub-gate synergy** — inside mind-vault, any namespaced ref whose suffix is not a placeholder is a violation by construction, so the whole class is now catchable with one grep (full pattern `IDEA-[0-9]{3,}:[a-z0-9._-]+` with a `:project-` placeholder carve-out; the truncated pattern is banned — it matched 362 ordinary idea-title colons when dry-run).

### Changed

- **Wired one-liners** at the write-sites that produce cross-project refs, with a `Wired:` list in the reference: `skills/idea/SKILL.md` § 4 (citing is the mirror problem of numbering), `skills/compound/SKILL.md` (foreign-class illustrations, drop-the-tag policy bullet — "qualified" now defined, optional grep aid, § 5 Cross-link, auto-memory write-up), `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 4 (devlog Related-section refs), `rules/RULE_cross-idea-amendments.md` (Amends-trailers are same-repo by construction).

## v5.5.2 — the two-readers rule now reaches every place that writes for the human gate

v5.5.1 created the rule but wired it into only one write-site (the compound skill's destination step). Every other surface that authors CHANGELOG sections, PR bodies, or reference prose never saw it — so the next `/wrap` or `/create-pr` would have reproduced the same dense register the rule exists to prevent. This release is the catchment sweep: a one-line pointer at each remaining write-site, and a `Wired:` list in the reference so the coverage is checkable. (2026-08-13, [#232](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/232))

### Changed

- **`skills/compound/references/mind-vault-promotion.md`** — the three sections in the same file that author human-read text (§ Self-mode CHANGELOG bump, § Commit format, § PR body skeleton) now each point at § Write for the two readers. The CHANGELOG section-shape bullet no longer says "match existing entries' prose density" — matching the old entries is exactly how the dense register would have survived. A `Wired:` list at the end of the section names every write-site carrying a pointer.
- **`skills/wrap/SKILL.md`** — the three places wrap writes human-read log text (self-mode Step 4's CHANGELOG bullets, docs-mode Step 4's devlog entries, Step 4b's headline paragraph) now say: plain register, and don't anchor on older entries. Step 4 carried the match-the-old-density trap twice — "see existing entries for prose-density anchors" (CHANGELOG) and "match prose density" (devlog) — both now removed. The devlog instance was caught by the claude review engine on this PR's first cycle, after the authoring sweep missed it.
- **`commands/create-pr.md`** — the PR-description step now instructs the plain register: the body is for a human reviewer, reading-speed sentences, never a compressed restatement of the diff.
- **`skills/skill-writer/SKILL.md`** — § Prose density gains the counterweight the tighten-pass was missing: density has a floor, and it is the concrete incident. A tighten-pass that cuts the worked example anchoring a pattern produces the unverifiable abstraction the v5.5.0 harvest shipped.
- **`skills/compound/SKILL.md`** — the References one-liner for `mind-vault-promotion.md` now surfaces the two-readers section, so load-on-demand discovery finds it.

## v5.5.1 — compound writes for two readers: plain for the human gate, dense-but-concrete-first for the agent

The v5.5.0 harvest was correct but exhausting to review — the maintainer's merge verdict was "this was a hard read". Root cause: every surface of the PR was written at the same maximum compression, including the surfaces only a human ever reads. (2026-08-13, [#231](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/231))

### Added

- **`skills/compound/references/mind-vault-promotion.md` § Write for the two readers** — CHANGELOG sections, PR bodies and commit messages are for the human reviewer: plain sentences, what changed and what it prevents, never a compressed restatement of the reference text. Reference and skill bodies stay token-dense for agent loading, but each pattern opens with the concrete incident or example before the general claim, one claim per sentence. Two-line stub with pointer added to the compound SKILL.md body.

## v5.5.0 — nine root patterns from one deferred harvest: assertions that never ran, runs that never reached, premises nobody falsified

From a batch harvest of a month's un-compounded engineering work across four repositories of one estate — every lesson counted for independent recurrence, checked against prior art, then attacked by two adversarial reviewers reading primary sources. 553 candidates reduced to 112, of which 23 survived review; those 23 turned out to instantiate **eight** root patterns, all written in this release. Patterns identified across the wider set but whose members did not survive review are deliberately **not** written — including the ninth, attested by 15 members and cleared by none. (2026-08-13, [#230](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/230))

### Changed

- **`skills/shell/references/EVIDENCE_SCRIPTS_AND_FALSE_CLEANS.md`** — the file's spine restated: **passing is the DEFAULT state of a broken check**, since no aggregate verdict distinguishes *asserted-and-true* from *never asserted*. Adds the assertion that **could not run** — a three-state `ASSERTED / COULD-NOT-RUN / FAILED` where could-not-run must be treated as failed, and the `<step> --apply && <step> --verify` anti-pattern, whose verify is skipped **exactly when the apply failed** while the same operator prevents errexit from stopping the run; the discrimination matters, since `--apply --verify` as one invocation is safe — the hazard is `&&`-list position, not the pairing. Plus the **fail-open branch that names an external cause**, converting a permanent defect into a plausible transient (audit whether its success value has ever once been recorded); the **unknown value needing its own refusing branch**, at both the comparing and the filling layer, because an unrepresented state lands on the benign side; and **a green run certifies only the state space it visited** — every substitute for reality is more forgiving than reality, with execution-context divergence (PATH, `profile.d`, stdin, tty, login shell) as one axis rather than a separate subject.
- **`skills/shell/references/SAFE_CONFIG_EDITS.md`** — the deciding property usually sits **outside the line you wrote**. Three shapes: **the consumer's grammar decides what your line means** — an ignore-file has no trailing-comment syntax, and a backup written beside a config file *is* a config file to any reader globbing the directory; **assert the SPAN you consumed, not the count** — an operation bounded by an endpoint someone else chose (a range whose end delimiter sits at a coarser level than its start; a deploy shipping the deployed ref's range rather than the PR diff), identical arithmetic at two scales; and **a missing bind-mount source becomes a root-owned directory**, visible only on a fresh clone, where `&&` swallows the status that would have told you.
- **`skills/shell/references/MAINTENANCE_SCRIPT_CONTRACT.md`** — a precondition that forbids a **name** encodes the author's model of the deployment rather than the property that decides correctness, so it over-refuses loudly while under-covering silently. Reconciles precondition-vs-verify against the existing fail-closed `--verify` rule instead of competing with it.
- **`skills/plan/references/DEFERRAL_EXPIRY_TRIGGERS.md`** — **a record is not a mechanism**, in two halves: *not refreshed* (what the file already covered, now named as one half) and *not enforced* — a statement true when written that no code path evaluates at the moment of action. Printed guidance and ignore-rules are the two instance families.
- **`skills/deployment/SKILL.md`** — **the defect is only visible from a side nobody stands on**: a probe that never leaves the box it tests can only prove the port is published; health checks watch the tier that was updated, not the background tier that also runs the code; one tree serves several runtimes. Reproduce from the affected party's position, or downgrade the claim to evidence about the producer.
- **`agents/AGENT_architect.md`** — a new pass for **the plausible account nobody made the system refute**: name the discriminating observation before concluding; a sample that cannot exhibit the failure proves consistency, not exclusivity; re-establish inherited claims, since true-when-measured is falsified by a later migration; removing a control needs hazard evidence, not an "already inert" sweep; and repeated verdicts from one engine are not independent samples. The pass now requires a premise ledger marking which sentences were **measured** versus **inferred**.
- **Consumer-pointer sync (post-write sweep)** — `skills/plan/SKILL.md` and `skills/plan/references/architect-handoff.md` now describe the architect as 5-pass; the reference-list one-liners in `skills/shell/SKILL.md` and `skills/plan/SKILL.md` surface the new sections so load-on-demand discovery finds them; a pointer to a never-written reference file in `EVIDENCE_SCRIPTS_AND_FALSE_CLEANS.md` replaced with the prose it stood for.
- **`docs/plans/2026-04-19-sprint-workflow.md` → `docs/archive/2026-04-sprint-workflow/`** — the founding sprint-workflow plan was the last live doc still describing a 4-pass architect (and retired bugbot personas); archived frozen with its historical wording restored and an archive banner pointing at `docs/guides/SPRINT_WORKFLOW.md`. `docs/plans/` remains the documented fallback location for future orphan plans.

## v5.4.9 — shadow observes but does not protect; sweep the false-clean CLASS, not the instance

From the live rung of the same staged rollout that produced v5.4.8, plus the review cycle over its evidence tooling. (2026-08-10, [#229](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/229))

### Added

- **`skills/shell/references/EVIDENCE_SCRIPTS_AND_FALSE_CLEANS.md`** — read-only scripts whose entire product is a claim about the world ("nobody hit the fault"). They change nothing, so they feel low-risk; a maintenance script that fails loudly costs an afternoon, an evidence script that fails **quietly** produces a green light someone acts on. Covers: the check that reports success without having run; sweeping the **class** across discovery / filter / parse / aggregate / print rather than patching the instance (observed three times in one review cycle — each correct fix left the identical silhouette one layer up); **a zero is only trustworthy beside a positive count** ("0 of type X" next to "1055 detected" is a measurement; alone it is an assertion); naming the distinct reasons for an empty result; announcing partial coverage, since a missing section reads as a complete report; and deriving targets from the **config** rather than a directory, systemd-unit-name or default-path guess — the most expensive variant being a scan that read the wrong files entirely and returned a confident zero.

### Changed

- **`skills/deployment/references/DARK_DEPLOY_KILL_SWITCH.md`** — two sections qualifying the existing "dark and shadow are safe to enable everywhere at once", which is true about *enabling* and reads as a licence to *linger*. **Shadow observes; it does not protect**: when the safe path is gated on the live value specifically, every other mode — shadow included — takes the destructive `else`, so shadow's own log lines describe writes that **happened**, not writes prevented. Staging therefore has a running cost the shadow log already quantifies (N divergences/day × days staged), and "we're on shadow so nothing bad is happening" is exactly backwards. Plus: **the staging unit is the ORGANISATION, not the tenant** — splitting one customer's sites across two policies makes the same workflow behave differently at two of their locations and renders any incident report unanswerable without first asking which site.
- **`skills/shell/references/SAFE_CONFIG_EDITS.md`** — flipping a key that may already exist: a `grep -q … ||` guarded append is **silently wrong on every run after the first**, including when the key exists with the wrong value, so gate on the **value** and refuse when the key matches ≠1 lines (a reader using `head -1` shows one value while `sed` rewrites all of them). Plus **stage → validate → `rename(2)`**: `sed -i` then validate leaves a window where the live file holds unvalidated content, and a kill in that gap ships it; edit a same-directory copy, validate the copy, then rename — atomic, and attribute-preserving because it is the same inode. With the three details that make it hold: a validator that **cannot run** is a failure not a pass, `trap` the staging copy (it carries whatever the config carries), and `flock` or a concurrent run's readback can make one operator's revert undo another's edit.
- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md`** — a **second refusal shape** beyond the documented skip-no-op: *"No new review performed — has already left multiple review comments on this PR"*, which is a refusal-with-a-reason rather than the terse skip, so a no-op list keyed on the known string misclassifies it as a substantive verdict. It survived four consecutive pushes across four head SHAs, all completing `success` with zero verdicts — the sharpest instance yet of a green check carrying strictly no review information. What got past it was not the documented `@claude review` override but a **question-shaped mention**: name the changed files, ask numbered concrete questions, and avoid the word "review".

## v5.4.8 — the OFF position of a kill switch must be faithful per call site; a zero needs a positive control

From a staged rollout of a matching-rule change against a third-party datastore. (2026-08-02, [#228](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/228))

### Added

- **`skills/deployment/references/DARK_DEPLOY_KILL_SWITCH.md`** — the dark → shadow → live ladder and what each rung actually proves. Headline trap: when N call sites are collapsed behind one flag, **the flag's OFF position must reproduce EACH site's prior behaviour, not the most common one**. Three sites unified behind one helper had *two* different legacy rules; a single `legacy` path would have silently loosened one of them while presenting as "switch off, no behaviour change, tests green". Also: rollback stops future writes but cannot unwind past ones; never leave two hosts running different write policies against one datastore; and shadow-that-logs-only-disagreements makes silence ambiguous between "never ran", "ran and agreed" and "logging broken".

### Changed

- **`skills/shell/references/MAINTENANCE_SCRIPT_CONTRACT.md`** — five siblings to the existing fail-closed `--verify` section:
  - **Test the operation, not its guard — break the TARGET, not the input.** Breaking the input trips an earlier precondition, so the stage under test never runs and the test passes vacuously. A restore-on-failure test was reported as passing without the restore ever executing.
  - **Error paths obey the happy path's contract.** An installer that stages-lints-renames must not restore with a plain `cp` over the live file; plus copy-don't-move the backup, validate it before installing, and note that rollback restores the prior file *mode* too.
  - **Verify the file you edited, never a glob.** A glob pulled in an unrelated file broken for five years; the `&&` short-circuited and the real verification never ran, while the edit had landed fine.
  - **A zero is only evidence if the method can produce a non-zero.** Ship a positive control in the same output; if the control is also empty, the instrument is broken, not the traffic.
  - **Prove a log line LANDS before letting the log inform a decision** — as the runtime user, on every host. A default log destination is a property of the host's config, not the language: one host recorded, another discarded, and the silence would have read as "no differences found". Includes the timezone caveat for cross-host correlation.
- **`skills/compound/SKILL.md`** + **`references/mind-vault-promotion.md`** — "stay on the feature branch" now requires that branch to still have an **open PR**. A checkout left on a branch whose PR merged weeks ago is the common resting state; committing onto it is worse than branch spam — dead ref, stale base for the version bump, and it reads as success. Reuse the *review surface*, not the branch name.

## v5.4.7 — deferrals need an expiry trigger, not just a successor ticket

A deferral justified by a claim about the *surrounding context* ("acceptable while all callers are
trusted") can never fire: the successor ticket waits on backlog priority while the condition that made
the justification true has already lapsed. Observed in the wild — an authorization gap stayed deferred
straight through the change that made it a real exposure, and surfaced only because a human asked
whether anything was left. (2026-07-27, [#227](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/227))

### Added

- `skills/plan/references/DEFERRAL_EXPIRY_TRIGGERS.md` — write the **invalidating condition**, not just
  the successor ticket, so the note argues against itself when the context moves. Carries the
  inert-vs-self-invalidating contrast, the plan/review check ("what would make this justification
  wrong?" — environment change ⇒ needs a trigger; someone-does-the-work ⇒ ordinary backlog item), and
  the reviewer heuristic against **inheriting** a prior deferral's justification, since citing a stale
  one launders it into the new plan.

- `skills/ideate/references/divergent-scan.md` — **Axis 9, Expired deferrals**: the sweep that *catches*
  an already-inert deferral, with grep recipes for context-justified language. Writing the condition only
  helps the next deferral; the ones already in the archive need somebody to notice the trigger fired, and
  that belongs at ideation — by plan time the work is already chosen.

### Changed

- `skills/plan/SKILL.md` — Scope Boundaries (step 4 of the plan structure) now points at the reference,
  since out-of-scope is where deferrals are actually written; References list updated.
- `skills/ideate/SKILL.md` — divergent-scan axis list gains Expired deferrals. Highest-yield axis on a
  mature codebase: no other axis finds these, because a deferral reads as "covered" (it names the risk,
  the successor and a reason) so every later scan skips it.
- Catchment sweep — deferrals get written at almost every workflow stage, not just plan scope
  boundaries, so every write-site now points at the reference: the plan template's out-of-scope
  placeholder, `/idea` non-goals (Phase B substitution + References), `/work`'s archive-README punt
  list (§ 6a), `/wrap`'s follow-up-flag disposition (Step 6), and `/review-loop`'s `NON_BLOCKING`
  formalize path. The reference's "Where this applies" section lists the wired sites bidirectionally.

## v5.4.6 — sweep integrity: an `--include` allow-list makes a completeness grep under-report

Compounded 2026-07-27 from a dead-code removal in a consuming project. The change swept the repo to
prove no live references to the deleted file remained, concluded "exactly five", and wrote that count
into four documents. Two more lived in `.env.*.example` templates — which match no source-code glob,
so the extension-filtered sweep never opened them. A review bot found what the sweep could not.
([#226](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/226))

### Changed

- `rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md` — new **Sweep integrity** section: when a sweep's job is to
  prove **absence or completeness** ("no references remain", "exactly N sites", "nothing else calls
  this"), never filter by file extension. `grep -rn "PATTERN" --include='*.py' --include='*.md' .` answers
  *"hits in the files I thought to look at"* and presents that as zero; config templates, dotfiles,
  extensionless scripts, unexpectedly-named CI YAML and generated manifests are all invisible to it.
  Exclude **directories** instead — a false positive from `vendor/` costs a glance, a false negative
  ships. Notably, trigger 5's existing count-claim check **cannot** catch this class: the count does
  match the listed set; the *set* is what's short. Generalised as **a negative result is a claim about
  your search, not about the repo** — before asserting "none remain", ask what the search could not
  see. Adds a matching "When This Applies" bullet for any commit whose message, PR body, or docs
  assert absence or a count.

## v5.4.5 — container `exec` umask inheritance; the recovery-recipe contract

Compounded 2026-07-23 from a containerized-app staging rollout in a consuming project, where a
recurring "unable to unlink … Permission denied" wall that had been treated symptomatically for three
rounds turned out to have one cause: `docker exec` does not inherit the entrypoint's `umask`. The same
rollout produced four consecutive review catches on a single dirty-tree guard — every one of them a
recovery recipe that read correctly and could not run.
([#224](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/224))

### Added

- `skills/deployment/references/ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md` — new section: **`docker exec` does NOT inherit the
  entrypoint's `umask`**. An entrypoint's `umask 002` covers the main process and everything it forks;
  `docker compose exec` spawns a fresh process attached to the container's namespaces, not a child of
  PID 1, so it starts at `022`. Build artifacts written by an exec-ed step land group-read-only, the
  host deploy user cannot unlink them, and the next `git pull` dies mid-update leaving the tree
  half-applied — surfacing as a git problem several steps from its cause. Includes the isolating tell
  (the app's own writes are fine, only the exec-ed path is broken) and both fixes: `umask` at every
  exec call site removes the cause, a default ACL is the backstop for writers you don't control
  (setgid inherits the group but not group-write).
- `skills/shell/references/MAINTENANCE_SCRIPT_CONTRACT.md` — new section: **a recovery recipe must be
  RUNNABLE in the session that prints it**. A guard's whole value is its recipe, and its characteristic
  failure is *plausible but unusable* — four shipped, reviewed instances catalogued (wrong identity:
  a script that guards on being unprivileged then emits `sudo`; wrong state: `git restore` cannot clear
  a staged addition; not-a-pathspec: splicing a rename's `old -> new` into a command; actively
  destructive: offering `git restore` on an unresolved merge). Two preventive habits: classify before
  advising and refuse when no single command fits (explicit "no recipe, here's why" beats a fabricated
  one), and execute the recipe you emit against real state. Sub-section on parsing structured tool
  output by documented **columns** rather than whitespace fields, plus not undoing it downstream via
  unquoted expansion or double-quoting what the tool already quoted.
- `skills/shell/references/MAINTENANCE_SCRIPT_CONTRACT.md` — new section: **a generated artifact on a
  fixed path outlives the code that generated it**. The `--emit-setup` pattern (bake real values into a
  self-contained script for an operator to run at higher privilege) has two failure modes that both
  look like success: staleness (a snapshot applies everything *except* the step added since, exits 0,
  prints a plausible summary) and foreign ownership (a shared `/tmp/<proj>` name already owned by
  another account fails with a bare `Permission denied`). Fixes: stamp the source commit and warn at
  run time on drift; default to a per-user path; pre-flight the target so the failure names the owner.
  Plus the ordering trap — emitting from a checkout *before* the deploy that updates it bakes in old logic.
- `skills/idea/assets/check-idea-frontmatter.py` — re-runnable guard for the YAML-octal id trap already
  documented in the `idea` SKILL.md: verifies ids are quoted strings matching their filenames, checks
  the `zfill(3)` **collision** (observed live in a consuming project, twice in one tree), and validates
  the id lists and `superseded_by` that the documented migration `sed` deliberately does not touch.
  Dogfood: mind-vault's own tree failed the guard with 45 problems, three of them live collisions —
  migrated separately in [#225](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/225).

### Changed

- `skills/idea/SKILL.md` — replaced the inline verification heredoc in the migration section with a
  pointer to the new asset. The snippet only checked id/filename agreement; the asset also catches
  collisions and unquoted list members. Re-framed as *run after every `/idea` capture*, not once at
  migration — some `/idea` implementations still emit unquoted ids, so new files reintroduce it.

## v5.4.4 — shell: interactive `sudo -i` login-shell `&&`-chaining trap

Compounded 2026-07-21 while writing rootless-docker service-user deploy command blocks for a consuming project. `sudo -iu <user> && cmd` runs the trailing commands in the PRE-sudo session, not the target user's — `sudo -i` opens an interactive login shell that must exit first. Silently executes half a pasted block under the wrong identity. ([#223](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/223))

### Added

- `skills/shell/references/INTERACTIVE_SUDO_LOGIN_SHELL.md` — the interactive sibling of `PRIVILEGE_DROP_PORTABILITY.md`: why `&&`/`;` after `sudo -iu` / `sudo -i` / `su -` binds in the caller's shell, and the two correct forms (become-user on its own line; or `sudo -iu <user> bash -lc '…'` with `-l` sourcing bash's login files — PATH, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, rootless `DOCKER_HOST`). Pointer added to the `shell` SKILL.md References list.

## v5.4.3 — deployment: render-and-deliver traps at a file-provider edge (mount inode-pin, empty-config abort, rate-limit threat model)

Compounded 2026-07-17 from a central Traefik edge's route-onboarding sidecar — a service that programmatically renders a file-provider fragment and delivers it into the proxy container for hot-reload. Three distinct **silent estate-wide outages** in one render-and-deliver pipeline, none of which a bring-up smoke test catches: the writer wrote but the consumer never saw it, the writer emitted an "empty" config that took down *all* routing, and a mount-layout mistake shadowed the static routes. The unifying lesson: **a delivery mechanism that passes "does it load at startup?" can still be fundamentally broken for updates** — test the second write, not the first read. ([#222](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/222))

### Added

- `skills/deployment/references/CONTAINER_SINGLE_FILE_MOUNT.md` — delivering ONE rendered file into a consumer container without silent staleness:
  - **A single-file / `volume.subpath` mount is INODE-bound.** It binds the target's inode at container-create, so an atomic-rename writer (`write tmp; fsync; rename` — the default "safe write" idiom) points the *name* at a new inode while the container stays pinned to the original → the consumer serves the first-ever content forever, no error anywhere. Fix: in-place `O_TRUNC` write (same inode), or mount the parent directory (path-tracked).
  - **A volume-at-a-directory SHADOWS the image's committed content — and copy-up happens once.** Mounting a volume at `/ctr/dir` hides everything the image committed there; a named volume copy-ups that content on FIRST use then freezes it, so rebuilt-image files never arrive — an estate-wide route drop/fossilisation from a mount-layout mistake. (Nested *explicit* binds DO compose — Docker sorts mounts by destination path.) Fix: overlay one file over a committed empty-but-parseable placeholder via a single-file/subpath mount, keeping the directory itself one canonical unlayered source.
  - **Isolation-test the WRITE cycle, not just container startup.** Startup reads the inode once and passes; the bug is the *second* delivery. The test must drive the real writer's code path against a real consumer and assert the change propagates (+ `stat` the inode if relying on the in-place fix).

### Changed

- `skills/deployment/SKILL.md` — `metadata.version` `'2.1'` → `'2.2'` (skill touched: References entries updated/added).
- `skills/deployment/references/TRAEFIK_EDGE_HARDENING.md` — two additions to the file-provider edge patterns:
  - **§6 empty-config abort (new).** A programmatically-rendered dynamic fragment must emit a bare `{}` when its table is empty. `{"http":{"routers":{},"services":{}}}` is **rejected** (`routers cannot be a standalone element`) and aborts the **entire** dynamic-config build — every `@file` router estate-wide (infra, dotfile guard, TLS) vanishes at once. A renderer that serialises its empty typed struct produces exactly this poison the first time its store is empty. Guard `if len(entries)==0 { return "{}" }`; commit the render only after Traefik reflects it (poll `/api/http/routers`) and roll back otherwise.
  - **§4 rate-limit threat model (extended).** A per-IP rate-limit caps only a *single runaway IP*; it is **not** distributed-DDoS defense (a botnet of N IPs each at ~1/s sails under any per-IP cap). So a tight value buys ~zero DDoS benefit and 429s legit asset-heavy pages — size `burst` to clear the heaviest single-page fan-out, lean generous, and treat volumetric attacks as an upstream/network-tier problem.

## v5.4.2 — deployment: remote-sudo/forced-command traps + systemd sandbox version gates

Compounded 2026-07-15 from br-docs IDEA-029 Phase 3 (an on-estate Loki backup: one box PULLs a snapshot from the bastion over a forced-command SSH key). Four bugs, and **every one of them lived in a path that only executes when something is unusual** — an error path, or a hardened-account path. A negative test on the *data* path passed and gave false confidence about the rest. That's the unifying theme: the code you exercise least is where these hide. ([#221](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/221))

### Added

- `skills/deployment/references/SHELL_INSTALLERS.md` — **patterns 16–20**, extending the catalog to remote-sudo and forced-command territory (16–17 are language-general, so per the file's layering note their full text lives in `skills/shell/references/STRICT_MODE_HAZARDS.md` §10–11 with stubs in the installer catalog):
  - **16. `rc=$?` after `if ! cmd` captures the NEGATED status** — always reports `rc=0`, so a real failure prints success and hides which end of a pipeline broke.
  - **17. Reading `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` RESETS `PIPESTATUS`** — the assignment is itself a command, so the next `${PIPESTATUS[1]}` reads a 1-element array and, under `set -u`, **aborts**. Converts an error *report* into a *crash*, on the error path only. Snapshot the whole array: `st=("${PIPESTATUS[@]}")`.
  - **18. `ssh -t` + command substitution = an invisible sudo prompt (silent hang)** — with `-t` the remote's stderr returns over the PTY and lands on ssh's local **stdout**, so `$( )` captures the `[sudo] password` prompt instead of showing it; `2>/dev/null` can't help because it was never on local stderr. Plus `use_pty`/`tty_tickets`: a new session is a new tty and needs a **fresh** password. Two fixes, preference-ordered (delete the prompt by staging; or `2>&1 | tee /dev/tty` to show *and* capture).
  - **19. Forced-command keys: an explicit PTY request is FATAL; a command-less ssh only warns** — `restrict`/`no-pty` refuses with the opaque `PTY allocation request failed on channel 0`, but the session dies (exit 255, forced command never runs) only when the PTY was requested *explicitly* (`-t`/`-tt`/`RequestTTY=yes|force` — easy to inherit from an outer `ssh -t` wrapper); a bare `ssh user@host` with tty stdin just warns and runs the forced command tty-less. Use `-T` for both cases; mandatory when streaming binary (a PTY mangles it with CR/LF translation).
  - **20. A `nologin` shell BREAKS SSH forced commands — it is not a security control.** sshd execs a forced command **through the login shell** (`$SHELL -c '<cmd>'`); `nologin` ignores `-c`, prints to **stdout** (not stderr), and exits 1. Symptoms all point away: ssh rc=1, remote stderr **empty**, the wrapper's own diagnostics absent, and the refusal text lands **inside the data stream** where `| gzip` compresses it.
- `skills/shell/references/STRICT_MODE_HAZARDS.md` — hazards **10–11**: the full text of installer patterns 16–17 (negated-rc capture after `if !`, PIPESTATUS reset-on-read), hoisted to the base shell layer per the layering note so non-deployment scripts get them too.
- `skills/deployment/references/HARDENING.md` — **"systemd unit sandboxing — gate on the CAPABILITY, never on a proxy for it"**:
  - **`SystemCallFilter=@system-service` requires systemd >= 240**, and older systemd does **not reject** it — it silently resolves to a ~40-syscall allowlist with no `openat`/`read`/`mmap`/`socket`. `execve` is allowed, so the process starts and the **dynamic loader** is denied `openat` — with `SystemCallErrorNumber=EPERM` (typical in hardening drop-ins) the service dies with `status=127`; the default action kills with SIGSYS → `signal=SYS`. The 127 signature is maximally misleading: it's the loader, not systemd (whose own sandbox failures are 226/228/203); the binary runs fine by hand; the identical unit works on a newer box. Verify with `systemctl show <unit> -p SystemCallFilter` — a ~40-entry list means the set didn't resolve.
  - Unknown **directives** degrade gracefully (warn + skip: `ProtectProc` 247, `ProtectClock` 245, `ProtectKernelLogs` 244, `RestrictSUIDSGID` 242); an unknown **set inside `SystemCallFilter`** does not.
  - **Gate on the capability, not the box's flavour.** `systemd-detect-virt = kvm` is a *proxy* for "modern enough to sandbox", and proxies break: one estate spans systemd **229 → 257**. Evaluate the real precondition on the target, fail safe both ways, and make the un-gated path `rm -f` the drop-in so a re-deploy **repairs** a host rather than needing manual surgery.

### Changed

- `skills/deployment/SKILL.md` — `metadata.version` 2.0 → **2.1** (skill touched). `skills/deployment/VERSION` stays **2.0**: that file is the **stack** version (Docker Compose v2), mirroring `django`→5.5 and `laravel`→12 — not the skill's.

### Fixed

- `tools/find_claude_comments.sh` — **the @-mention task shape (`**Claude finished @user's task…**`) is now recognized as a full verdict surface**: `claude finished` (the action-generated stable header) added to `CLAUDE_BODY_SIGNATURES`. Dogfooded on this very PR: the `@claude review` retrigger answers via `claude.yml` in the task shape, whose body carried a real blocking finding **four cycles in a row** while the BOTH-AND summary filter dropped it (no "code review" phrase in the body → `CLAUDE_HEAD_VERDICTS=0` → UNPROVEN/SILENT; the coexisting auto-run "No issues found" summary false-CLEANed the two cycles it posted). Regression fixture `tests/fixtures/claude/task-shape-retrigger/` (clean summary + task-shape finding on one SHA must enumerate both); new calibration section in `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md`.
- `skills/deployment/references/HARDENING.md` — the capability-gate example itself carried an `A && B || C` trap (the finding above): a failed `install_dropin` both fired the destructive `|| rm -f` branch AND was masked (chain exits 0 under `set -e`). Now an explicit `if`/`else`, with the trap called out inline.

### Security

- **Never claim a security property you have not tested.** The `nologin` shell in pattern 20 was documented as one of four *controls* bounding a privileged (`docker-ops`) grant. It was not a control — it made the feature **inert** while *looking* correctly bounded, which is the failure mode you don't notice, because "no backups yet" is indistinguishable from "not scheduled yet". The real bounds were the forced command, `restrict`, a root-owned wrapper, and no password. Corollary from the same cycle: the `restrict`→`no-pty` control **proved itself** by refusing our own client (pattern 19) — the refusal was correct; the bug was ours.
- **Check for prior art before writing a new remote-sudo helper.** Fix 2 in pattern 18 (`2>&1 | tee /dev/tty`) already existed in the source repo (br-docs `install-key.sh`); not looking cost a silent one-minute hang in front of the operator.

## v5.4.1 — deployment: Loki/promtail pipeline traps + rootless dual-port wedge

Compounded 2026-07-14 from a live estate log-aggregation bring-up (Loki + promtail for auth/SSH),
where every item below shipped past config review AND a passing dry-run, and was caught only by
querying live data.

### Added

- **`skills/deployment/references/MONITORING.md` — "Loki + promtail: four traps that make the pipeline
  lie rather than fail."** (1) No `timestamp` stage ⇒ promtail stamps **ingestion** time, so a
  first-run backfill replays days of history into one window — spurious burst alerts, worthless
  timestamps, inert `reject_old_samples_max_age`, and a **historical security event replayed as a live
  critical**. Includes a stage handling BOTH rsyslog formats (one estate ran both) with the `location`
  that a year-less format silently needs. (2) promtail's `replace` substitutes **capture groups** —
  `${1}` backrefs emit literal text, mangling the line while NOT redacting the secret. (3) An
  over-matching redaction regex **blinds the alert rules** (rewrites `Accepted password for root` so
  the root-login rule can't match) — a strictly worse trade than the leak; require the separator.
  (4) LogQL `count by (x) (count_over_time(...))` counts **series** (incl. `__stream_shard__`), not
  distinct label values — needs an inner `sum by (x, label)`. Plus: narrow-scrape journald on
  `__journal__comm`, never the user-settable `__journal_syslog_identifier` (or `logger -t sshd` forges
  criticals) — and the corollary that `logger`-based smoke tests then false-negative.
- **`ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md` — publishing the same host port on two IPs WEDGES the daemon.** Deadlocks
  rootlesskit's builtin port driver: container stuck in `Created` with no logs, `docker
  logs`/`inspect`/`rm -f` on it hang while the rest of the daemon is fine, `compose up` blocks,
  `slirp4netns` spins. Each publish alone works; the pair is fatal. Includes the 30-second busybox
  repro and the fix (publish one IP).
- **`ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md` — a rootless daemon restart can silently leave services DOWN.** Containers
  exiting **non-zero** on SIGTERM are NOT restarted despite `restart: unless-stopped` (observed:
  Prometheus/Grafana returned, Alertmanager/blackbox did not — alerting died while dashboards looked
  healthy). Always `docker ps -a` after a restart; prefer `docker start` over `compose up`.

## v5.4.0 — idea: quote frontmatter ids (`id: "035"`) — the silent YAML-1.1 octal misparse

Compounded 2026-07-14 from an estate-monitoring project where an agent built an idea-status table and
IDEA-035 silently overwrote IDEA-029 — the second time the same bug surfaced in one session.

### Fixed

- **`skills/idea/assets/idea-template.md` now quotes `id:` and `title:`.** A bare zero-padded id is
  **YAML-1.1 octal**: `id: 035` parses to the integer **29**, with no error. `/idea`'s own
  zero-pad-to-3-digits rule is what triggers it. `035` comes back as IDEA-029's number, so the two
  collide as soon as tooling normalises ids — one silently overwrites the other. `title:` is quoted
  for a second, same-root-cause bug: an inner
  colon (`(pilot: client.example.com)`) raises `ScannerError` and kills the *entire* frontmatter block.
- **`skills/idea/SKILL.md` §4** documents the failure mode, the reason it survives, and a **verified
  migration** for existing projects (both `id: 017` and legacy `id: IDEA-017` forms → `id: "017"`,
  idempotent, plus a detector for colon-bearing unquoted titles). Also: **read ids from the FILENAME,
  not the frontmatter** — it is octal-immune and survives an unparseable block.
- **`superseded_by:` quoted everywhere the skill models it** — the status-transition table, the
  template comment, and the reference docs (`IDEAS_LOCATION_STATUS.md`, `update-semantics.md`) now all
  show quoted ids, so no instruction in the skill surface re-teaches the bare form it just killed.

### Why it hid for so long

It is a **sub-100 problem**. Of ids `001`–`099`: **56** (`010`–`077`, digits all `0`–`7`) get a **wrong
value**; `001`–`007` become int `1`–`7` (value right, type wrong); the **36** containing an `8` or `9`
stay strings and are right **by luck**; `100`+ has no leading zero and is safe — so the bug ages out
before a project is old enough to notice. The collision needs one more step: raw, `035`→`29` (int) and
`029`→`'029'` (str) differ — but `str(29).zfill(3)` == `'029'`, so any normalising reader collides them.
And **nothing in the workflow parses idea frontmatter** (`/idea` writes it, humans read it), so YAML
never gets a chance to raise. It surfaces only when someone writes tooling — and then as *silently
wrong data*, not an error.

Migration verified against a 37-idea project: 34/37 ids misparsed before, 36/37 correct after, with the
remaining one correctly flagged by the title-colon detector for a hand-fix.

## v5.3.10 — deployment: rootless docker-ops ACL mask + operator-vs-service-account + host-write subuid ownership

Compounded 2026-07-13 from a rootless-Docker monitoring-stack adaptation on a stripped-OpenVZ bastion (a `stack.sh` that wrapped the now-masked rootful daemon), via [#218](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/218).

### Added
- `skills/deployment/references/ROOTLESS_DOCKER_OPENVZ.md` — **the socket ACL survives reboots but the
  parent-*directory* ACL's mask doesn't.** The `0700` runtime dir gets `chmod`'d by the daemon *after*
  `ExecStartPost setfacl`, which rewrites the POSIX mask to `---` → the `docker-ops` entry reads
  `#effective:---` → daemon unreachable to the whole group after every restart (looks like a dropped
  grant; it's a masked one). Fix: the dir `ExecStartPost` must wait-for-socket and set `m::` explicitly
  (`setfacl -m g:docker-ops:rx -m m::rx`); one-shot live repair is the same setfacl. Checklist tightened.
- `skills/deployment/references/ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md` — two rootless-identity traps. (1) **Operator-owned
  config ↔ `sudo -u docker` don't mix**: the service account can't traverse the operator's `0700`/`0750`
  home to read the compose file/`.env` (`stat …/.env: permission denied`) → pick run-as-service-account
  (config under `~docker/`) OR operator-as-self (compose via the socket ACL), and `sudo rsync` to seed a
  service-account-owned mount root. (2) **Host-written, container-read files need the container SUBUID,
  not the in-image uid**: the userns remap makes a host-`65534` `0600` secret "other" to a container
  running in-image `65534` (host `subuid_base+65533`) → perm-denied config-load crash; own it as the
  subuid and preserve that across re-renders.

## v5.3.9 — laravel: composer build-PHP ≠ runtime-PHP platform pin

Compounded 2026-07-09 from a containerized-Laravel deploy that fataled on first request with a
`platform_check.php` gate, via [#218](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/218).

### Added
- `skills/laravel/references/CONTAINER_BUILD_PLATFORM.md` — the `composer:N` build image tracks the latest
  PHP, so a lockless `composer update` resolves deps against a PHP newer than the `php:X-fpm` runtime and
  bakes a `platform_check.php` gate that fatals on first request. Fix: pin `config.platform.php` in the
  **build stage only** (not the repo-wide `composer.json`, which would break other-PHP consumers) and use
  `--ignore-platform-req='ext-*'` so `php` stays enforced while only the runtime-installed extensions the
  composer image lacks are ignored. References-list pointer added to `skills/laravel/SKILL.md`.

## v5.3.8 — deployment+shell: Traefik v3 edge hardening + rootless source-IP masquerade + remote black-box verify

Compounded 2026-07-06 from a public Traefik-v3-on-rootless-Docker edge sprint (dotfile-deny + rate-limit + a version bump); amended 2026-07-07 with the apply/wrap-phase traps ([#217](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/217)).

### Added
- **`skills/deployment/references/TRAEFIK_EDGE_HARDENING.md`** (new) — native dotfile-**404** at a
  Traefik v3 edge with no plugin/container (high-priority catch-all router + `ipAllowList` sentinel
  range + `rejectStatusCode`, short-circuiting before a fail-closed dummy-server `noop`); the
  **`.well-known`/ACME-renewal carve-out** (RE2 no-lookahead → `&& !PathPrefix`; blocking
  `/.well-known/acme-challenge/` kills HTTP-01 renewal → cert expires → edge down); per-router
  rate-limit hygiene; and the **version-bump audit drill** (latest-minor-only support, `acme.json`
  format unchanged v3.4–v3.7 → cert reused, `%2E` pre-routing normalization, cert-reused-first gate +
  reviewed rollback); plus the **outbound-egress canary** for cert renewal (the carve-out guards only
  the inbound challenge path; renewal also needs outbound reach to the CA — probe it after any
  host-network change). Pointer added to the deployment SKILL References list.

### Changed
- **`skills/deployment/references/ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md`** — rootless Docker's default port driver
  **masquerades the client source IP** to the bridge gateway (per-IP rate-limit collapses to global;
  logs/geo/allowlists blind) → `slirp4netns` port driver / `pasta` network driver; the **blast-radius
  rule** (a net-stack env change reaches only *user-manager*-mode hosts, not *system-unit*/OpenVZ ones —
  enumerate modes before claiming coverage); and **verify BOTH directions** — a net-stack swap can
  silently kill *outbound* egress, and since ACME renewal is outbound + deferred to ~30d pre-expiry,
  broken egress passes every inbound smoke test then expires the cert weeks later → gate on an active
  in-container egress probe, and read source IP from an external host (hairpin masks it). Plus driving
  `systemctl --user` for the service account **from root** via `su` (not `--machine`, whose
  `journalctl` needs machined).
- **`skills/shell/references/MAINTENANCE_SCRIPT_CONTRACT.md`** — remote black-box `--verify` must
  assert the **positive** code (`= 200`), so `curl … || true` → `000` on an unreachable target fails
  **closed** (a negated `!= 404` false-passes while the service is down); rate-limit load-tests need
  **concurrency**; `openssl x509 -dates`/`-startdate`, not the nonexistent `-notBefore`.
- **`skills/deployment/references/CICD.md`** — `gh pr edit --title/--body` aborts on Projects-classic
  (GraphQL `projectCards`) → patch via `gh api … -X PATCH` (REST).
- **`rules/RULE_git-safety.md`** — documented the **`main` over-match** that *string-level* guards
  (permission-layer patterns, outdated naive hooks — NOT the shipped per-segment hook, which allows
  the chain) hit on compound commands (`git push <feature> && gh pr create --base main …`) → split
  the push and the pr-create into separate invocations (not a break-glass case); and the **stacked-PR
  retarget race** — merging a dependent PR seconds after its base can merge it into the obsolete base
  branch, stranding the work off `main` (the auto-retarget fires on head-branch **deletion**, not the
  merge; diagnose with `baseRefName` + `merge-base --is-ancestor` on the **merge commit** — a squash-
  merged tip false-alarms; recover by cherry-picking onto a fresh main-based branch; avoid by
  confirming the retarget or `gh pr edit --base main` before merging the dependent PR).
- **`skills/compound/`** — fact-check discipline for version-gated claims: verify "added in vN" /
  "absent until vN" assertions against release notes or the introducing PR (never version-pinned doc
  pages), demote unverifiable gates to observations-with-provenance, and attribute an observed
  block/denial to the right guard layer before documenting it. Stub in SKILL step 3 + full section in
  `references/mind-vault-promotion.md` (born from this PR's own review sweep, which caught both
  failure shapes).

## v5.3.7 — deployment+shell: git-pull deploy cutover + rootless-sudoers + privilege-drop portability + compound self-bump backstop

Compounded 2026-07-05 from an edge deploy-productionization session (git-pull-as-service-account cutover onto a rootless-Docker box); single-PR section, provenance in the PR.

### Added

- **`skills/shell/references/PRIVILEGE_DROP_PORTABILITY.md`** — an unqualified `runuser` in a setup script dies `command not found` on Debian in non-root / non-login contexts — a **PATH trap, not packaging**: Debian ships it in `/usr/sbin` (off the default PATH exactly in the automated contexts setup scripts run in), while `setpriv`/`su` are `/usr/bin`-homed and reachable everywhere (confirmed on Debian 13 + 12 hosts). Prefer `setpriv --reuid … --regid … --init-groups -- env HOME=… <cmd>` (argv passed directly → no quoting fragility; inherits the caller's env untouched, so override `HOME`) or `su -s /bin/bash <user> -c '…'` (shell-string; mind nested quoting + the "prompts for the target's password when run non-root" trap) — or absolute-path `/usr/sbin/runuser` — and add the chosen tool to the dep preflight. Pointer added to the shell SKILL.md References.

### Changed

- **`skills/deployment/references/GITHUB_APP_DEPLOY_CREDENTIALS.md`** — two more Gotchas: (5) the stateless helper **`. source`s** its env file, so `DEPLOY_TOKEN_PERMISSIONS` **MUST be single-quoted** (`'{"contents":"read"}'`) — unquoted, the shell strips the inner quotes → POST body `{"permissions":{contents:read}}` → GitHub **HTTP 400** "token mint failed" (not 401/403, so it doesn't read as auth); (6) wire the helper **host-level** (`credential.https://github.com.helper`), not path-qualified + `useHttpPath` — a clone URL's `.git` suffix defeats the path match, git skips the helper and dies `could not read Username` (a path-qualified key on a multi-repo host must include `.git`).
- **`skills/deployment/references/ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md`** — new "scoped-sudoers operator model" section: `sudo -u <svc> systemctl --user` needs **`SETENV:`** on the grant or sudo's `env_reset` refuses the required `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (scoped to the systemctl grant, `docker` listed first so the tag doesn't carry); and first-time setup *as* the service account needs **break-glass root** (the scoped grant permits `(svc) docker` + `(svc) systemctl --user`, not `git`/a login shell), while routine ops stay scoped-sudo.
- **`skills/deployment/references/CICD.md`** — an idempotent-setup-script-over-multi-context-runbook section (self-test the credential *before* relying on it; handle re-runs; safe `base64` transfer) and a durable-checkout **cutover** section (reconcile the running stack's compose project name or a parallel `up -d` collides on published ports; reuse a literal-named state volume so a TLS cert is reused, not re-issued; verify green before teardown); plus anti-patterns for multi-privilege-context runbooks and destructive cleanup before verification.
- **`skills/compound/SKILL.md` + `references/mind-vault-promotion.md`** — self-mode bump hardening, prompted by this PR's own review sweep: the branch step now does a **single `git fetch origin` before branching off `origin/main`** (the whole freshness protocol — a stale local ref is how colliding versions get computed; compound runs are minutes, so no push-time re-fetch ceremony), and the bump step gains a **mechanical pre-commit assertion** — the staged CHANGELOG diff must ADD a new `## v` header (bullets appended into the released top section are the recurring miss) and `jq -r '.version' .claude-plugin/plugin.json` must equal the new top CHANGELOG version. Both halves were missed in the wild (PR #214 → fix PR #215; PR #216 pre-sweep) — a prose instruction alone did not hold.

## v5.3.6 — git-safety structural enforcement + rootless-Docker-on-OpenVZ + review-loop zero-row guard

Compounded from a cross-project infra program (deploy-credential + rootless-Docker + cert-monitoring work across an estate of OpenVZ boxes).

### Added

- **`hooks/block-protected-branch-writes.py` + `hooks/hooks.json`** — a `PreToolUse(Bash)` hook that **structurally enforces** `RULE_git-safety` § "never merge/push into a protected branch": it *denies* `gh pr merge`, `gh api` merge/protected-ref *writes* (read-only probes of the same endpoints pass), and direct/force/bare pushes to `main`/`master`/`production`/`deployment` at the tool layer, while letting feature-branch pushes, forward-sync merges, and `gh pr create` through. Matching is shell-aware — shlex tokenization, per-command evaluation across `&&`/`;`/pipe chains, heredoc-body stripping — so `git -C <path> push`, quoted refspecs, and `sudo`/env-prefixed forms are caught while commit messages *quoting* the forbidden commands are not; a bare `git push` on a protected checkout is caught via a cwd branch probe. Break-glass is `GIT_SAFETY_ALLOW=1` prepended (the agent must not self-add it). Fails **open** on any internal error. Ships wired into the plugin's `hooks.json` alongside the SessionStart rule-loader, so every rule consumer gets the enforcement, plus an 86-case deny/allow self-test battery (`hooks/test-block-protected-branch-writes.py`). Provenance: an agent merged to protected `main` with `RULE_git-safety` loaded and quoted — the behavioural rule was necessary but not self-enforcing.
- **`skills/deployment/references/ROOTLESS_DOCKER_OPENVZ.md`** — getting rootless Docker to *run at all* on a stripped cgroup-v1-only OpenVZ VPS (no per-user systemd, no cgroup delegation, no FUSE, no persistent `/dev/net/tun`): the root-owned `docker-rootless.service` system-unit recipe replacing `systemctl --user`, plus five compensations each tied to one reproducible error (static `crun` ≥1.14.3 + `--cgroup-manager=disabled` wrapper; a `dockerd-cgroupless` wrapper stacking an empty tmpfs over `/sys/fs/cgroup` in the rootlesskit ns; `vfs` storage; `/dev/net/tun` tmpfiles; socket-ACL usability layer). Gate on a per-box symptom probe, not `uname`. Cross-linked from `ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md` (the socket-resolution trap, a separate problem) + pointer in the deployment SKILL.md References.

### Changed

- **`rules/RULE_git-safety.md` + `docs/rules/RULE_git-safety-rationale.md`** — rule body gains a tight "being asked is not authorization" clause + a "Structural enforcement" pointer to the new hook; the rationale doc gains **"Behavioural rules need a structural backstop for irreversible ops"** — the generalisable lesson (any rule guarding a merge-to-protected / force-push / `rm -rf` / destructive-migration wants a tool-layer deny, not just context) and the backstop's design constraints (deny the narrow catastrophic set, allow adjacent; fail open; a deliberate grep-able break-glass; ship enforcement with the rule).
- **`skills/review-loop/references/common-review-findings.md`** — catalogue entry #23: **atomic-write generator overwrites live output with an EMPTY result on an upstream-read regression**. The `write-tmp-then-mv` idiom silently publishes *nothing* when the source read yields 0 rows (format shift, regex miss, transient empty) — the atomic `mv` makes it worse (clean swap to empty, no partial-file signal, and the alert that would fire is defined over the now-absent series). Fix: fail closed on `[ "$n" -gt 0 ]` before the `mv`, keep last-good, exit non-zero; **sweep every atomic-write sibling** (the defect travels in sibling generators).
- **`skills/deployment/references/GITHUB_APP_DEPLOY_CREDENTIALS.md`** — new subsection "Granularity across a fleet": one read-only Deploy App **per repo** (not one estate-wide App — a shared key clones the whole fleet); run the deploy as the repo's **existing** deploy account (`sudo -u <existing-account>` — swap the auth mechanism without moving filesystem/runtime identity); **per-developer** install when the actor is a workstation not a server.

## v5.3.5 — review-loop + django/django-frontend: App-DRIVEN loop + KaTeX/markdown render traps

Compound from a frontend dependency sweep + a math-rendering feature shipped while the agent session authenticated as a **GitHub-App bot actor**. Follow-on to v5.3.4 (which covered the deploy-credential + bot-*opened*-PR-being-reviewed half): this is the half where the App **drives** its own review loop, plus reusable Django static/markdown rendering traps and the vendored-static Dependabot variant (npm-ecosystem manifest + re-vendor CI).

### Added

- **`skills/review-loop/references/GITHUB_APP_DRIVEN_LOOP.md`** — running the loop as a `<your-app>[bot]` actor (not a human `gh auth`). The `@claude` retrigger silently drops because a bot comment is `author_association=NONE` → fix the `claude.yml` job `if:` with an **exact-login OR-clause** + `allowed_bots` on the action (both default-branch-only); a chicken-and-egg note (the amendment's own PR still needs one human retrigger). Plus: dependabot slash-commands (`@dependabot recreate/rebase`) are **human-push-access-only** (App rejected); the `gh` **App-token mint shim** (`ensure_gh_auth`) for agent hosts where gh is unauth but `git push` works; and the App-token **CI-read scope gap** (`checks:read`/`actions:read` 403 → read PR comments, not check-runs). Pointers from review-loop SKILL.md + dependabot-triage SKILL.md.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/CLIENT_MARKDOWN_RENDERING.md`** — two browser-side LLM/markdown traps: (1) the pre-markdown tag-stripper must be **tag-shaped** (`/<\/?[a-zA-Z!][^>]*>/g`) not "any `<…>`" (`/<[^>]*>/g`) or it eats prose arrows + comparison operators (XSS still stripped); (2) the model emits **fully-resolved URLs**, not your link pseudo-scheme, so a reroute must reverse-match resolved same-origin URLs as a superset of the scheme parser (persisted history re-renders client-side → one hook covers live + history). Pointer from django-frontend SKILL.md.
- **`skills/dependabot-triage/references/VENDORED_STATIC_REVENDOR.md`** — the vendored-browser-asset Dependabot variant (synthetic npm-ecosystem manifest pinning files committed in `static/` + a re-vendor CI workflow that commits refreshed bytes onto the PR branch). Why these PRs stick at `mergeable_state: "unstable"` with no re-vendor commit (the CI commits only if `npm install` + copy + integrity all pass → a **stale map `src` for a new major's dist layout** kills the job silently); major-bump dist-layout traps (a lib dropping its root min build → vendor `lib/*.umd.js`; an icon/font lib consolidating compat into the woff2-only `all.min.css` → src must be the all-in-one, not the `@font-face`-less core); the committed file may be a **hand-concatenation** the 1:1-copy model can't reproduce (latent map-vs-reality drift); **local re-vendor reproduction** (`node:20-alpine` + `--network host` + `--ignore-scripts`, stage only the bumped dep's files per commit); and **consolidation-as-unblock** (fold the stuck PRs into one agent-authored branch — produces the re-vendor commits CI couldn't, fixes the map srcs, and escapes both bot-actor gates at once). Pointer + trigger keywords from dependabot-triage SKILL.md.

### Changed

- **`skills/django/references/MANIFEST_STATIC_FILES_STORAGE.md`** — new section: vendoring a CSS that references fonts must vendor **every format the `@font-face` `src` names**, because `collectstatic` rewrites each `url()` and **hard-fails on a missing target** (not a warning). A woff2-only subset (fine when the lib's own CSS is woff2-only, e.g. FA7) breaks the build for a lib whose stock CSS lists woff/ttf too (e.g. KaTeX); editing the vendored CSS breaks faithful-re-vendor `--check`. Verify with a `DEBUG=False` `collectstatic`.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/PREVIEW_DRAWER_URL_STACK.md`** — new section: a third-party render hook (math/diagram/highlight) renders inside the preview drawer **for free** by riding the drawer's dispatched `htmx:afterSettle` (`detail.elt = host`) — bind the helper to the htmx lifecycle scoped to `detail.elt`, no preview-specific call site.
- **`skills/dependabot-triage/SKILL.md`** — anti-pattern added: don't drive `@dependabot recreate/rebase` from a bot/App (rejected, human-push-access-only); recreate after the conflicting base PRs merge, issued by a human. Also: vendored-static variant callout + description trigger keywords + `Composes with` pointer to the new `references/VENDORED_STATIC_REVENDOR.md`.
- **`.github/workflows/claude.yml` + `claude-code-review.yml`** — mind-vault now dogfoods the App-driven review loop the new `GITHUB_APP_DRIVEN_LOOP.md` documents: admit `teisutis-agent[bot]` via `allowed_bots` on the review action + an exact-login OR-clause in the interactive `@claude` `if:` gate (scoped to the one App, not `'*'`). Without it a bot-opened PR on this repo ships UN-REVIEWED (the action's non-human-actor guard fails the run). Must reach the default branch to take effect.

## v5.3.4 — deployment + review-loop: GitHub App deploy/automation credentials

Compound from a read-only GitHub App deploy-credential pilot that replaced a personal SSH key standing on a production server, expanded mid-flight into a two-App program (a read-only deploy box + a write-capable automation host). The reusable patterns: the security invariant behind needing two Apps, the on-box token-mint helper shape, the unprivileged deploy-user wiring, and the CI-config gotchas that bit during the rollout.

### Added

- **`skills/deployment/references/GITHUB_APP_DEPLOY_CREDENTIALS.md`** — replace personal SSH keys / PATs on servers with **short-lived GitHub App installation tokens minted on-box** (stateless git credential helper; openssl RS256 JWT → `/app/installations/<id>/access_tokens`, no `jq`/`gh`, no token at rest; per-mint scope env can only down-scope). The **two-Apps-not-one invariant** — an App's permission set is the *ceiling for any holder of its private key*, so per-mint down-scoping is hygiene not a boundary, and a read-only deploy box + a write automation host must be **separate Apps**. Deploy (read-only) vs automation (write + gh-less PR via the installation token) cases; the **unprivileged deploy-user wiring** (`$HOME`-relative paths need the `!`-shell helper form so `$HOME` expands; `credential.useHttpPath` host-vs-path silent no-op); mint hardening (numeric-id validation, `--max-time`/`--connect-timeout`). Pointer added to the deployment SKILL.md References.

### Changed

- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude-onboarding.md`** — new **`allowed_bots`** section: `claude-code-action` aborts the review on a **bot-opened PR** ("non-human actor") unless the bot is allow-listed via `allowed_bots: '<app-slug>[bot]'` on the **default branch** (the action reads the workflow from the default branch, not the PR copy); scope to the specific bot, not `'*'`, so dependabot/renovate don't burn metered Actions minutes. The review-side half of an App-opens-PR automation loop actually getting reviewed; distinct from the `@claude` author-association gate (which *blocks* untrusted bot triggers).
- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md`** — Silent-run failure-mode row gains a confirming anchor: a *first* un-draft/initial auto-run can come back SILENT (#1087) and a single explicit `claude_retrigger.sh` then produces a full verdict — the retrigger recovery works on the first review too, not only after a fix push (its first response may be the in-progress checklist, so wait for a substantive verdict before judging).

## v5.3.3 — shell + deployment: live-host nginx/TLS maintenance patterns

Compound from a live apex-redirect + Let's Encrypt rollout on a busy reverse proxy (2026-06-19). General live-host-ops machinery split into the shell maintenance-script contract; nginx/TLS specifics into a new deployment reference (the DRY-RUN/`--apply`/`--verify` machinery is good practice independent of nginx, so it lives in the language layer, not the domain one).

### Added

- **`skills/deployment/references/NGINX_TLS_REDIRECT_AND_CERTS.md`** — redirect vhost + Let's Encrypt on a proxy with many vhosts: the apex is often served by `default_server`/first-`ssl` *fallthrough* (so the change is **additive**, not replace — a new explicit `server_name` block wins `:80` by name and `:443` by SNI, nothing disabled); two-phase `:80`→issue→append-`:443` (a `:443` block can't reference a cert that isn't issued yet); the ACME-challenge `location` must stay a more-specific prefix than the `301` redirect (nginx picks longest-prefix, not file order) as a **standing** renewal precondition; the served mismatched/expired default cert is not yours. Pointer added to the deployment SKILL.md References.

### Changed

- **`skills/shell/references/MAINTENANCE_SCRIPT_CONTRACT.md`** — four general additions: (1) `--verify` **polls** the served effect after a graceful reload / eventual-consistency lag rather than one-shotting (old workers drain on the previous state → false negative on busy hosts); (2) keep the **full** stream in the evidence log but filter *named known-benign* per-item warning floods off the operator terminal (`tee … | grep -vE "$NOISE"`), never a blanket `2>/dev/null`; (3) **locate by exact token, refuse on ambiguity** — a `\bname\b` regex false-matches `sub.name` (punctuation is a word boundary), and a shared target gets a fail-safe stop, not a guess; (4) **detect the mechanism, don't hardcode one variant** — the same capability ships under different unit/tool names (renewer: `certbot.timer` vs `snap.certbot.renew.timer` vs `cron.d/certbot`; firewall: ufw/firewalld/nftables), so a check keyed on one name false-fails the others.

## v5.3.2 — shell: root-via-sudo git "dubious ownership" trap + denial-vs-ENOENT path caveat

Patch release (2026-06-18, compound, [#210](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/210)). Extends `skills/shell/references/SUDOERS_WHITELIST_FENCES.md` from field experience building a read-only audit probe that shells `git`/`find` as root through the sudoers fence. Sequences after v5.3.1 ([#209](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/209)) — no substantive-file overlap (only the shared CHANGELOG anchor, resolved on rebase).

### Added
- **Trap 4 — a whitelisted `sudo -n git …` that matches and runs can still abort rc=128.** Run as root on a non-root-owned repo, `git ≥ 2.35.2` refuses with "detected dubious ownership" (CVE-2022-24765) — so a root probe fails on exactly the hosts whose deploy checkouts aren't root-owned, while root-owned repos elsewhere succeed (a maddening per-host split). Remedy: declare `-c safe.directory='*'` in the whitelisted command, safe **only** for pure reads that execute no repo-controlled code (no hook / fsmonitor / pager / alias; never `config --list`). A silently-failed `status` otherwise false-reads a dirty tree as **clean** — the Trap-3 disaster in a new disguise.

### Changed
- Trap 3 forensic shortcut: the "uniform stderr length ⇒ denial" heuristic **inverts** for tools whose fatal embeds the target path (git names the repo) — stderr length varies with path even on failure, looking like the ENOENT case it isn't. Fall back to rc + message (rc=128 fatal ≠ rc=1 sudo denial ≠ rc=127 missing-binary).
- Trap 2 caveat: a backslash carries no globbing risk, but it is the sudoers **escape character** (`sudoers(5)`), so `visudo -cf` parses `\n` / `\.` silently as an escaped letter and the command then fails to **match** at runtime — the same silent mis-match as `*?[]`, not a loud parse error. Remedy unchanged: keep declared arguments to plain-word patterns.

## v5.3.1 — RULE_cross-idea-amendments: review-engine carve-out for IDEA-attribution comments

2026-06-17. Single-PR section.

### Changed

- **`RULE_cross-idea-amendments` step 2 gains a review-engine carve-out.** The `IDEA-NNN` attribution prefixes the rule mandates on amended-file inline comments get flagged by review engines (Claude Code Review, Bugbot) running a generic "no unnecessary comments" instinct — a non-convergent cosmetic nit that survives every review-loop fix cycle. The rule now tells projects to pre-empt it by **documenting the carve-out in their `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`** so the engine reads it as context, and to **never strip the prefixes** (that breaks the greppable amendment trail the rule exists to preserve) — the `COSMETIC_NONCONVERGENCE` hard-stop applies.

## v5.3 — review-loop: claude verdict by model-judge, not regex

Minor release ([IDEA-022](docs/archive/2026-06-idea-022-claude-findings-heuristic/IDEA-022-claude-findings-heuristic-false-positive.md), [#208](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/208)). The claude review engine's verdict classification moves from a prose **regex classifier** to an orchestrator-inline **model-judge** emitting `{CLEAN | BLOCKING | NON_BLOCKING[]}`. Regex can't classify model-generated prose — it false-FINDING'd a clean "all resolved" recap (a convergence-blocker, surfaced in the IDEA-021 dogfood on PR #207) and false-CLEAN'd a marker-less prose finding (the architect hole); same root failure in both directions. `find_claude_comments.sh` is reduced to surfacing review material; the `/review-loop` judge classifies. The carve-out is typed to *prose-only verdict surface* (claude has no structured surface — its verdict IS prose), not the engine name — structured-surface engines (bugbot/copilot) keep the structural "clean, never prose" rule untouched, and a future prose-only engine inherits the judge path. Architect-reviewed ×2. Also folds the IDEA-021 Monitor-robustness compound (this PR's branch). The verdict judge ships unproven against live prose — its first real exercise is the `/review-loop` over this very PR.

### Changed
- `tools/find_claude_comments.sh` — reduced from prose REGEX CLASSIFIER to MATERIAL-SURFACER. Removed `CLAUDE_CLEAN_PATTERNS` / `CLAUDE_FINDING_MARKERS` / `is_clean` / `CLAUDE_HAS_FINDINGS` / the masking-suppression branches / `CLAUDE_CLEAN_SIGNAL` / the green clean banner. Kept (named) STATUS aggregation across head-SHA runs, the in-window verdict enumeration (now **raw + verbatim bodies, unclassified**), `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN` (now **emitted** as a marker, was internal), inline enumeration, and the NOOP / draft / silent / settle structural guards. Net: the script gets simpler. Added a `CLAUDE_FIXTURE_DIR` test seam (additive; production path unchanged).
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` — new **§ Verdict judge** contract: judge prompt, tiered-verdict schema, the **verbatim masking rule** + proven-set fail-closed, the false-CLEAN-dangerous instruction (IDEA-018 philosophy), the structural-vs-semantic split, and the **honest backstop split** (structural anchor for inline-thread findings; judge-instruction + proven-set for summary-body-only findings — no "guarded two ways" overclaim, architect C1). Clean-detection + review-state-gate sections rewritten to defer to the judge; regex-era calibration blocks banner-superseded (kept as judge *input* — "what claude's prose looks like in the wild").
- `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` — **§ Per-engine model-judge** dispatch (cache the verdict per head SHA — it's a model call); the typed carve-out on the "clean is structural" rule; `BLOCKING`→iterate, `CLEAN`/`NON_BLOCKING`-only→clean for the multi-engine sync gate; the R3 disposition **mode-split** (interactive surfaces + proposes `/idea`; sprint-auto auto-formalizes IDEA files via `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE`) + the **in-PR-IDEA acknowledgment convergence loop** (a committed IDEA doc is the in-band signal the next cycle's judge reads to stop re-raising); `claude_judge_verdict` + `claude_non_blocking[]` scratch slots.
- `skills/review-loop/references/multi-engine-sync.md` — scratch schema + convergence-gate composition: a claude `NON_BLOCKING`-only verdict counts clean for the all-engines gate (items carried to hand-back / auto-formalized), proven-set fail-closed still applies.
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md` — the claude-row "clean source" cell + the clean-structural framing gain the prose-only-surface carve-out (surfaced by this wrap's Step 6 downstream-docs scan; the cell still described the removed regex mechanism).
- `skills/work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md` — added Hard Rules 7 + 8 for `Monitor` / background poll-scripts: never `set -u` (the sourced host shell-snapshot references unbound vars like `ZSH_VERSION`; nounset turns that into a fatal flood that silently stalls the loop), and match poll markers with subshell-free case-insensitive `grep -iE "^${e}_MARKER="` (nested `$(… | tr …)` anchors parse mismatched in the background shell). Both are the "silent-timeout" failure class — only safe when the watcher is an accelerator over a resilient spine ("correctness never depends on the accelerator"). Compounded from the IDEA-021 review-loop Monitor dogfood.

### Added
- `tests/test_claude_material_surfacing.sh` + `tests/fixtures/claude/` (6 fixtures) — the **asymmetric test gate** (architect C2): (a) deterministic material-surfacing (STATUS, in-window verdict enumeration, verbatim bodies, `CLAUDE_VERDICT_SET_PROVEN`); (b) the **false-CLEAN hard gate** on the structurally-detectable part — for the dangerous fixtures (summary-body-only blocking finding, dual-verdict masking, marker-less prose, unprovable verdict set) the adapter MUST surface the concern verbatim + hold the structural fail-closed, so the judge can't be starved of a masked verdict; the semantic NOT-CLEAN *reading* of pure prose is judge-eval/advisory (a model can't run in bash CI); (c) advisory CLEAN-vs-NON_BLOCKING (the dogfood clean-recap fixture, the original false-positive). `make test-claude` + a `make test` aggregate target.

## v5.2 — review-loop: Monitor-accelerated Phase 4 wait

Minor release ([IDEA-021](docs/archive/2026-06-idea-021-monitor-accelerated-review-loop-wait/IDEA-021-monitor-accelerated-review-loop-wait.md), [#207](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/207)). The `/review-loop` Phase 4 wait gains an event-driven accelerator: a bounded, read-only `Monitor` re-enters the loop the moment an engine verdict lands, instead of polling blind on a fixed cadence — inspired by Fable 5 actively hunting review comments as they arrive. The `ScheduleWakeup` spine remains the resilient backstop (lengthened to 20 min), so the Phase 4 decision logic is unchanged and correctness never depends on the Monitor (a vanished/auto-stopped Monitor is a silent no-op). Architect-reviewed 🟡 → must-fix F1/F3 + should-fix F2/F4/F5 folded.

### Added
- `skills/review-loop/references/MONITOR_ACCELERATION.md` — loop-agnostic recipe for the accelerator: the poll-script template (read-only — calls only `find_*_comments.sh`, never a `*_retrigger.sh`; `cd`-inside-loop per WATCHER_HYGIENE Rule 4; **frozen `ARM_SHA` vs live HEAD** for sha-change detection, mirroring Phase 4 step 3; engine-error as a strict subset of the escape-hatch table, **never** off `CONCLUSION`), the three trigger events (`all-done` / `sha-changed` / `engine-error`), the `TaskStop`-first-on-every-wake GC discipline + the vanished-Monitor-is-a-no-op rule, and the narrow bounded-`timeout_ms` carve-out from WATCHER_HYGIENE Hard Rule 3 (read-only API pollers only, not test watchers).

### Changed
- `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` — Phase 4 backstop cadence 270s→1200s (the Monitor handles fast detection; the `ScheduleWakeup` is the resilient spine); `max_idle_polls` 20→10 in Hard bounds (10 polls ≈ 3.3h, within `max_active_work_minutes`); Phase 4 step 1 arms the Monitor after the scratch write; step 2 makes unconditional `TaskStop` the first action of every wake; decision-tree idle branch updated; References entry added.
- `skills/review-loop/references/multi-engine-sync.md` — **F1**: de-numbered the leaked `max_idle_polls × 270s` budget (both factors changed under this release) to reference `SKILL.md` § Hard bounds + Phase 4 step 1 by name; added the "the Monitor's `all-done` trigger is this sync gate in event form" pointer.

- `docs/guides/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` — converted the integration-branches ASCII fan-out diagram to a mermaid `flowchart` (single integration-branch node fanning out to per-IDEA PRs and emitting the `[INTEGRATION]` PR to `main`), matching the repo's other mermaid diagrams.
- **Dogfood-hardened** (live `/review-loop 207` run of this very feature surfaced six fixes across two cycles, all folded in):
  - Monitor poll-script matches markers with case-insensitive `grep -iE "^${e}_CHECKRUN="` — the prior nested `$(… | tr a-z A-Z …)` parsed to a mismatched anchor in the Monitor's background shell, so it never detected `all-done` and timed out silently (cycle 1).
  - Monitor poll-script uses `set -o pipefail` only, **never `set -u`** — the Monitor's sourced shell-snapshot references `ZSH_VERSION` unbound, which nounset turns into a fatal flood that stalls the loop (cycle 2).
  - `engine-error` trigger narrowed to `failure|cancelled|timed_out` (drops `action_required`/`neutral` — normal findings-bearing completions caught by `all-done`; bugbot completes findings as `neutral`).
  - Monitor re-armed as part of a single **wait-state bundle** on every decision-tree loop-back, not just first entry (gap flagged by bugbot's own review of this PR); the vestigial 180s first-poll dropped to the 1200s backstop from the first wait.
  - Scratch-persistence `idle_polls` cap corrected `/20 → /10` to match the lowered bound (flagged by claude's review).
  - Both engine failures were silent no-ops absorbed by the `ScheduleWakeup` backstop + adapter re-fetch — the "correctness never depends on the Monitor" resilience design validated under two real Monitor failures.

### Fixed
- `docs/guides/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` — corrected a stale multi-engine note that claimed claude "needs no explicit retrigger / the loop skips claude in the retrigger step". Since the dual-substantive-verdicts correction, claude **is** retriggered after a fix push once it has posted its first review (the `synchronize` auto-run skip-no-ops); only a still-in-flight first review withholds it. Brought in line with `SKILL.md` Phase 3 + `engine-claude.md` § A7. (Pre-existing drift surfaced by this PR's wrap Step 6 scan.)

## v5.1.14 — compound: OpenRouter reasoning-token streaming + disconnect-persist instance state

Patch release. Compounded from an LLM-chat feature on a consuming Django project (making assistant reasoning functional, persisted, and displayed) — surfaced two reusable lessons. References-first; one minimal SKILL.md pointer.

### Added
- `skills/django/references/OPENROUTER_REASONING_API.md` — OpenRouter reasoning-token streaming: request the top-level `reasoning.effort` param (maps to Gemini `thinkingLevel`); read-back via `delta.reasoning` (string) AND/OR `delta.reasoning_details[]` (typed: `reasoning.text` readable vs `reasoning.encrypted` opaque) — there is NO `delta.thinking` field; the **dual-channel dedup gotcha** (OpenRouter mirrors the same reasoning into both channels → yielding from both double-persists; prefer the array, fall back to the string only when the array is absent); reasoning **encrypted on tool-CALL turns** (echo it back for chain-of-thought continuity); tokens under `usage.completion_tokens_details.reasoning_tokens`. Pointer added to `skills/django/SKILL.md`.

### Changed
- `skills/django/references/ASYNC_WEBSOCKET.md` — added "Persisting partial streamed content across a mid-stream disconnect": the stream accumulator MUST be instance state (`self.x`), never a method-local — `disconnect()` is a separate method and can only reach instance attributes; init once before the tool-call loop (no per-iteration reset); thread the buffer through ALL save sites (success / failed / disconnect) via one consolidated helper.

## v5.1.13 — compound: rootless-Docker deploy gotcha + Actions-billing review diagnostic

Patch release. Compounded from a production rollout on a consuming project — the first deploy after a rootless-Docker cutover failed because a non-login deploy shell (`screen … bash -c`) misses the profile `DOCKER_HOST` and hits the dead rootful socket, making an idempotent deploy script misread "first-time deployment". References-first; zero SKILL.md-body additions.

### Added
- `skills/deployment/references/ROOTLESS_DOCKER.md` — rootless-Docker deploy shells must resolve the rootless socket; the `DOCKER_HOST`-vs-`docker context` distinction (env var lost in non-login shells; context is shell-independent), the `! docker info`-guarded `DOCKER_HOST` auto-detect helper, and an adoption checklist. Pointer added to `skills/deployment/SKILL.md` References.

### Changed
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` § Failure modes — new "Actions billing wall" subsection: on a private repo, exhausted Actions minutes / failed payment make every workflow fail at **startup** (no steps, ~2s, `runner=""`, annotation names billing). Signature distinguishes it from a real engine failure (unrelated workflows failing at the same instant with no steps); orchestrator surfaces it to the user and does NOT retrigger (only the Actions-based claude engine is affected, not app-based bugbot/copilot).

## v5.1.12 — sudoers whitelist fences (2026-06-12, compound)

Lessons from a 14-host fleet audit-whitelist deploy on project-x.

### Added

- `skills/shell/references/SUDOERS_WHITELIST_FENCES.md` — NOPASSWD command-whitelist
  matching traps on heterogeneous fleets: stat-based entry-path matching (pre-usrmerge
  `/bin` vs `/usr/bin` dead entries), fnmatch argument semantics (path-template wildcard
  holes, regex-metachar self-destructing entries, offline fnmatch round-trip test),
  sudo-denial vs file-absence rc ambiguity (stderr-signature classification, uniform
  stderr-length forensic), dot-staged `visudo`-before-`mv` deploy, content-hash parity
  verify via the service identity, and guard-skip classification of fleet cron lines.
  Pointer added to the shell SKILL.md references list.

## v5.1.11 — shell skill + dual-verdict engine calibration (2026-06-11, compound)

Single-PR compound section.

### Added

- **`skills/shell/`** — new base shell-**language** layer beneath `deployment` + the
  devops persona (the `python`-tier analog for ops bash), two tiers, seven references.
  **Language mechanics** (any bash script, upstream canon verified against BashPitfalls /
  BashFAQ 105/045/062/035 / ShellCheck wiki / Google Shell Style Guide): strict-mode
  hazard catalog (`set -euo pipefail` as tripwire-not-seatbelt — pipeline-in-assignment
  silent abort, SIGPIPE/`head` race, SC2155 `local` masking, condition-context errexit
  transitivity, SC2164 cd guards, never-retrofit stance), quoting/input hygiene
  (arrays-for-lists, `"$@"`, `printf` over `echo`, `IFS= read -r` + subshell trap,
  `case`-not-`grep` validation, heredoc discipline, getopts-vs-manual judgment call),
  and cleanup traps + temp files + `flock` single-instance locking. **Live-host ops
  machinery**: DRY-RUN/`--apply`/`--verify`/`--revert` maintenance-script contract with
  the **interactive precondition-acknowledgement gate** (block on a literal `yes` from
  `/dev/tty` BEFORE any connection/mutation — a checklist that prints while the action
  runs is decoration), SSH fleet patterns (cold-probe hygiene, one-login ControlMaster
  apply mux, scaffold-copy extraction counter), validator-less config edits with
  diff-shape assertions (`.bak` + exactly-one-line post-edit check), and evidence-gated
  remediation for intermittent faults (historical log fingerprints over point-in-time
  probes; `--preventive` waiver; gate-equivalence dry-runs fail closed). 22nd skill
  row in README.
- **AGENT_architect PASS 3** — gate-design probe: point-in-time probes cannot govern
  intermittent faults; demand recorded-evidence conjuncts + fail-closed gate-equivalence.

### Changed

- **`deployment/references/SHELL_INSTALLERS.md` dedup** — the language-general entries
  (1–3, 5, 8, 10, 11: pipefail family, arg validation, `case`-vs-`grep`, heredoc,
  substring anchoring) hoisted into `shell`'s references; the installer catalog keeps
  numbered stubs (numbering stable for the review-findings cross-reference) and the
  installer-specific patterns (chown, marker blocks, opt-out sweep, target-user
  resolution). `deployment/SKILL.md` References gains the base-layer pointer — same
  point-down relationship `django` has to `python`.
- **AGENT_devops** — shell-craft pointer added: bash authoring/review reaches down into
  the `shell` skill instead of restating script mechanics in the persona.

- **engine-claude calibration — dual substantive verdicts (second downstream, 2026-06-11):**
  the §48 "subsequent pushes auto-skip" model is **install-dependent** — a non-skipping
  install produced two full reviews per SHA that DISAGREED (findings-bearing auto-run
  verdict masked by a later clean retrigger verdict → false CLEAN hand-back). New adapter
  rule: wait for ALL head-SHA runs to complete, read EVERY substantive verdict, and let any
  unaddressed findings-bearing verdict keep the engine STILL_FINDING — a newer clean
  verdict never overrides it. `commands/review-loop.md` + `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md`
  hard "no double-run" claims softened accordingly.

## v5.1.10 — compound: Celery task hygiene + review-engine adapter calibrations

Patch release. Compounded from a Celery-optimization cycle on a consuming Django project (a reindex post-mortem quantifying ~38.6k overhead-dominated tasks, dead result rows, an nproc-sized worker fleet, and a scheduler that had been silently dead for months) plus one multi-engine review-loop run that exposed two adapter blind spots. References-first; zero SKILL.md-body additions.

### Added

- **`skills/django/references/CELERY.md` § Task Hygiene** (new section): ignore-results-by-default + per-task opt-in (`CELERY_TASK_IGNORE_RESULT` / `CELERY_RESULT_EXPIRES`), the **beat auto-adds `celery.backend_cleanup` even under django_celery_beat's DatabaseScheduler** gotcha (an explicit schedule entry duplicates the daily run — docs folklore says otherwise, empirically false), the delayed-coalescing debounce recipe for signal-driven fan-in (one `cache.add` gate + `apply_async(countdown=window)` inside `on_commit`; ≤2×window convergence; rollback can't consume the gate), env-driven worker sizing (`--concurrency` + `--max-tasks-per-child` — CPython keeps peak heap), and beat-as-first-class-service.
- **`skills/django/references/MULTI_TENANT_CELERY.md`** new pitfall: with django-tenants + the django-db result backend, **TaskResult rows scatter across tenant schemas** (the worker writes through its tenant-aware connection; the "current writer" schema drifts over months) — audits/purges must sweep `information_schema` for every copy of the table; `backend_cleanup` only cleans the schema it runs in; without `CELERY_RESULT_EXTENDED`, `task_name` is NULL and forensics are unrecoverable.
- **`skills/django/references/MANIFEST_STATIC_FILES_STORAGE.md`** new section: test assertions on static names must be **hash-robust** — literal `'<stem>.js'` substring assertions pass on every DEBUG=True dev box and fail on any DEBUG=False host; `stem(\.[0-9a-f]+)?\.ext` regex + a shared `find_static_asset()` position helper for ordering assertions; negative assertions need `assertNotRegex` too.
- **`skills/deployment/references/MONITORING.md` § Scheduler Liveness and Service-Inventory Checks** (new section): schedulers manually started inside another service's container die silently on recreation (months-dormant schedules, zero alerts) — run them as first-class compose services; plus inventory-based stack verification (`docker compose config --services` enumerated by name vs `ps` status, profile-aware, non-zero exit) replacing container *counting*.

### Changed

- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md`** new calibration block: a clean-prose summary CAN coexist with inline-only findings (3 inline finding comments, each its own single-comment review, followed seconds later by a clean-reading summary → adapter false-cleaned) — enumerate `/comments` independently every cycle; in-flight **progress comments** (unchecked `- [ ]` checklist) match the `## Code review` signature but are not verdicts — treat as RUNNING. Residual Q1 answered (inline findings post as separate single-comment reviews, no shared review id) and Q2 closed (the `@claude review` comment-trigger fallback exercised and working).
- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-copilot.md`** new failure mode: **silent request consumption** — the reviewer request disappears (`requested_reviewers` empty) with no review, no check-run, no error body; 2× consecutive → ERRORED, exclude from the multi-engine sync wait, point the user at org Copilot settings.

## v5.1.9 — compound: mock.patch stack leak + heal-and-attribute canary

Patch release. Compounded from a dependency-batch verification on a consuming Django project where a 2-test full-suite-only deterministic failure root-caused to a cross-layer mock leak (51 leak points named by the canary in one run). References-first; one new reference, no SKILL.md-body bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/python/references/MOCK_PATCH_STACK_LEAK.md`** (new): two test layers patching the SAME `mock.patch` target with mixed stop disciplines (base-class tearDown stop + subclass addCleanup stop) invert the stack unwind — the subclass stop re-installs the base's MagicMock onto the process global, poisoning every later test on the xdist worker. Rules: never re-patch a target the base already patches (the redundancy IS the bug); one target / one layer / one stop discipline; `addCleanup` immediately after `start()`. Plus the heal-and-attribute autouse canary (names each leaker, heals the global, no cascade — one diagnostic run attributes everything) and the reproducibility tells (full-suite deterministic + isolated green = worker-state leak; `--dist loadscope` reshuffles make long-latent leaks surface after unrelated test-adding PRs; a victim with accumulated non-sticking isolation fixes means the corruption is upstream).

## v5.1.8 — compound: anonymous-gate dual + structured error detection

Patch release. The tail of a deferred compound sweep over two earlier sprints on a consuming Django project (a public-nav fix and a search-index dimension migration). References-first; one new reference + one section extension, no SKILL.md-body bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/python/references/STRUCTURED_ERROR_DETECTION.md`** (new): classify a caught client-library exception on its structured error body (`err.body` → `error.root_cause[].type/reason`), never the rendered message string — two narrowing layers (exception class + body predicate) so a resilience path skips only the one precise upstream failure and propagates everything else. Test contract: construct synthetic exceptions WITH a real `body` dict (bare-message exceptions leave the structured path unexercised); pair positive with negative cases (same exception class, different reason → must propagate).

### Changed

- **`skills/django/references/PERMISSION_GATE_PROBE.md`** new § *The anonymous dual — "anon sees nothing" is a premise, not a fact*: on public-content apps, a blanket anonymous short-circuit (204/login-wall) on a shared endpoint breaks every anon-reachable surface it serves — anon flows through the same resolver with `visible_to(None)` doing the narrowing (private rows return empty; the short-circuit buys no security). Telltale regression symptom: works on cold load (server-rendered), breaks on client-side re-fetch. Review bots love suggesting the guard; the premise is false on public-content apps.

## v5.1.7 — compound: nav-chrome consolidation doctrine + e2e corpus/seed/locator learnings

Patch release ([PR #199](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/199), which also carries the missed `plugin.json` manifest bump for v5.1.6). Cross-project learnings compounded from a nav-consolidation sprint on a consuming Django project. References-first; one new reference + three section extensions, no SKILL.md-body bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/NAV_CHROME_CONSOLIDATION.md`** (new): doctrine for collapsing N near-duplicate chrome copies into one canonical component — (1) a `variant` prop rendering structurally different markup is still a fork (one markup tree, conditionals gate slots/items, never parallel structures); (2) single-slot placement policy for cross-surface affordances, encoded once in shared chrome ("in app-nav when present, else header; exactly one per page"); (3) identity-slot mutual exclusion — anon and authed affordances are one slot in two states, rendered from one shared `{% if authed %}` block; (4) the generation-vs-display debugging tell — a "broken" feature may be working generation with a lost render target; grep the chrome for the context key before debugging the generation path.

### Changed

- **`skills/django/references/IDEMPOTENT_SEED_COMMANDS.md`** new § *Key the lookup on the IMMUTABLE natural key*: `get_or_create` lookup kwargs must be the row's natural identity (`email`+`org`), never a mutable state field (`status`) — a test that transitions the state makes the next seed run miss and create a duplicate; live-DB e2e accumulates one duplicate per run, invisible on fresh volumes.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/MULTI_TENANT_PLAYWRIGHT.md`** new § *Shared corpus is READ-ONLY* (+ anti-pattern bullet): mutation tests provision a dedicated disposable row; mutating shared-corpus rows couples other tests to alphabetical test-file ordering — failures appear when an unrelated test file shifts collection order.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_ALPINE_WAITS.md`** new § 9 *Debugging tell — sub-second failure is strict-mode multi-match, not absence*: absence burns the full assertion timeout; a ~1s fail is Playwright strict-mode refusing multiple matches — selector too broad or a genuine duplicate render. Opposite fixes; adding waits buries the duplicate.

### Fixed

- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** version bumped (was left at `5.1.5` by PR #198, making the v5.1.6 release invisible to the plugin update channel — `marketplace.json` carries no version field, so `plugin.json` is the sole version source).

## v5.1.6 — compound: CSP inline-handler delegation + shared-widget lazy-load guardrail

Patch release. Cross-project frontend learnings compounded from a CSP-hardening sprint (drop `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` by converting native `on*=` handlers to delegation) + a load-on-nav script-trimming sprint. References-first; one new reference + one section extension + a pointer, no SKILL.md-body bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/CSP_INLINE_HANDLER_DELEGATION.md`** (new): converting native `on*=` / `javascript:` URIs to body-level `addEventListener` delegation to drop `'unsafe-inline'` (Alpine `@click`/`hx-on::` are eval-based → keep `'unsafe-eval'`, untouched). Three traps: (1) **drop `|escapejs`** when a value moves from a JS-string context into a `data-*` HTML attribute — escapejs emits `\uXXXX` that renders literally; rely on HTML autoescape; (2) `textContent` does NOT decode HTML entities but `getAttribute` does — a hardcoded `&quot;` in a JS fallback renders raw; (3) bind drawer-injected widgets on `htmx:afterSettle`, not `afterSwap`. Plus: delete dead handlers rather than convert; lock with source-assert + an e2e CSP-violation probe (curl can't see CSP refusals).

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/LAZY_LOAD_HEAVY_ASSETS_ON_HTMX_NAV.md`** § *What stays eager*: added the shared-form-widget mis-classification trap — a colour/icon picker or accessibility-enhancer *looks* surface-specific but is needed wherever its form appears (multiple surfaces + drawer-injected forms the manifest's nav path never reaches). Rule: shared-widget dependencies stay **eager**; the per-surface lazy manifest is for heavy single-owner assets only. Small-or-shared → always eager; heavy + single-owner → the only lazy candidate.

## v5.1.5 — compound: sprint-auto Batch-1 review-loop learnings

Patch release. Cross-project learnings compounded from a multi-engine (`bugbot,claude`) sprint-auto batch whose review loop surfaced several real defects the happy-path tests + architect passes missed. References-first; no SKILL.md-body bloat.

### Added

- **`RULE_self-sweep-before-push`** (defensive-code sweep): a guard that *selects* rows for a downstream consumer must replicate the consumer's FULL acceptance predicate, not the subset a plan/architect named — else the consumer bounces the row and a re-feeding path loops or silently drops. Validate against the consumer's real acceptance code, not the plan's prose.
- **`AGENT_curator`** PASS 3: subclass override-completeness — when a base method calls `self.get_X()` and a subclass overrides only some hooks, the inherited path uses the base value for the missed one (e.g. an embed subclass missing a fallback-URL override → full-shell redirect inside an iframe). The class-hierarchy twin of Layout-sibling parity.
- **`AGENT_test-engineer`** PASS 2: discrimination check — an isolation/routing test where both arms share the same state passes for the wrong reason; make the arms differ so a mis-route flips an assertion.
- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md`**: double-run friction — a fix-push `synchronize` auto-run (skip-no-op) plus an explicit retrigger create two runs for one head SHA; treat a substantive posted verdict as DONE even if the latest Actions run lingers `in_progress`.
- **`skills/sprint-auto/references/worktree-lifecycle.md`**: `post_up_init` must build EVERY runtime artefact the suite reads (notably `compilemessages` — translation-asserting tests fail in a fresh stack otherwise); and the per-IDEA DB `down -v` reset is skippable for pytest-only IDEAs with no migrations + e2e absent.
- **`skills/wrap/SKILL.md`** Step 2: flip `status:` AND `completed:` AND the body `**Status**` line together — grep-verify all three (frontmatter field order varies; a block edit can miss `status:`, and a doc-review engine catches it inconsistently).

## v5.1.4 — fix: plugin SessionStart hook hard-failed (exit 2) under POSIX sh

Patch release ([PR #195](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/195)). On a fresh plugin-only machine the `SessionStart` rule-loader hook could abort with **exit 2** instead of degrading gracefully, breaking session startup rather than falling back to the `/mv:load-rules` pointer note.

### Fixed

- **`hooks/load-rules.sh` — re-exec under bash if invoked via `sh`/`dash`.** The script opened with `set -euo pipefail`; `set -o pipefail` is a bashism that a POSIX `sh`/`dash` rejects with `Illegal option -o pipefail` and **exits 2** — *before* any of the graceful `emit_note` fallbacks could run. The hook command wraps the script in `bash`, so a pristine install is protected, but a host that routes hook commands through `sh -c` (or a shebang-only exec where bash wasn't the interpreter) detonated on the first body line. Added a POSIX-clean guard ahead of the `set` line — `if [ -z "${BASH_VERSION:-}" ]; then exec bash "$0" "$@"; fi` — so the script always re-enters under bash (it legitimately needs bash arrays + `shopt nullglob`). All invocation paths (`bash`/`sh`/`dash`, with `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` set or unset) now exit 0.

## v5.1.3 — IDEA-020: channel-aware inner dispatch + agent rename (plugin-route correctness)

Patch release ([PR #194](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/194), IDEA-020). Makes the workflow skills' **executed** sibling dispatches resolve under the plugin's `mv:` namespace, not just the symlink channel — the silent-failure class surfaced by going plugin-only (a skill spawning a sibling by bare name doesn't resolve when only the `mv:`-namespaced plugin is installed). Generalises the review-loop `reentry_command` fix (v5.1.2) across all three dispatch mechanisms, and **drops the redundant `mv-` agent prefix** so the plugin persona form is the clean `mv:architect`.

### Added

- **`skills/work/references/CHANNEL_AWARE_DISPATCH.md`** — the shared convention covering all three *executed*-dispatch mechanisms (`Skill` tool → `mv:<skill>`, literal slash → `/mv:<command>`, `Agent` `subagent_type` → `mv:<persona>`), invocation-form detection (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is not in the agent shell — mirror how you were invoked, persist the prefix), the executed-vs-prose test, and the dual-mode (token-OR-inline-path) fail-safe exception. Pointed at by review-loop, work, plan, and sprint-auto.

### Changed

- **Persona dispatch is channel-aware** — `work/references/persona-dispatch.md` + `work/SKILL.md` matrix resolve `mv:<persona>` on the plugin channel + gained a host-availability inline fallback; `plan/references/architect-handoff.md` documents the dual-mode exception. `/work`'s persona layer covers sprint-auto's personas transitively (the highest blast radius — unattended overnight).
- **sprint-auto stage dispatch is channel-aware** — S(-1) detects + persists `channel_prefix` to the batch state file (same rail as `SPRINT_AUTO_PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE`); every stage dispatch resolves via `${channel_prefix}`.
- **Docs** — channel-safety caveat on the sprint-auto-VPS plugin recommendation (README + ONBOARDING): the workflow's executed dispatch is channel-safe as of v5.1.3+; `/plugin update` to at least that version before running sprint-auto plugin-only.

### Removed

- **The `mv-` agent-name prefix** — all 8 profiles renamed `name: mv-<persona>` → `name: <persona>` (`architect`, `backend`, …). The prefix existed to dodge shared-registry collisions; now that mind-vault *is* the plugin, the plugin's `mv:` namespace disambiguates, so `mv-` was redundant and `mv:mv-architect` doubly-prefixed. Plugin form is now `mv:<persona>`, symlink form bare `<persona>`. (Trade-off: symlink-channel agents lose the `mv-` collision guard — low risk; plugin-channel is primary.)

## v5.1.2 — compound: plugin channel = stable/dev release-channel split (authoring vs consuming)

Patch release (`/compound`). Dogfooding IDEA-017 surfaced that the marketplace install runs a **pinned snapshot** (git-cloned to `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/mind-vault`), not the working tree — edits go live only on `/plugin update`. Doc-only clarification of what that means per machine role.

### Changed

- **`README.md` + `docs/guides/ONBOARDING.md` — "Authoring vs consuming" guidance** on the plugin install. The pinning is the channel's point, not a limitation: a **consumer** machine wants the marketplace plugin (`/plugin update` per release); the **authoring** machine gets a stable/dev split for free (pinned plugin = stable runtime insulated from WIP, working tree = where the next version is built, `/plugin update` = the promotion gate — the compound floor rises per *release*, not per keystroke). Authors who want live skill edits use symlinks or `claude --plugin-dir`. Inverts the earlier "the plugin breaks compounding" read — it's a deliberate release-channel separation a symlink setup can't give.

### Fixed

- **`skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` — `ScheduleWakeup` re-entry is now channel-aware.** The loop self-invokes via a literal slash command in its wakeup `prompt`; a hardcoded `/review-loop` doesn't resolve on a **plugin-only** machine (commands namespace to `/mv:review-loop`), so the wake fires but the loop never re-enters. The re-entry token is now `<reentry_command>` — `review-loop` on the symlink channel, `mv:review-loop` on the plugin channel — mirrored from the invocation form (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` isn't exposed in the agent shell) and persisted to the scratch file so it survives compaction. The documented carve-out from IDEA-017's "don't rewrite bodies channel-aware" rule: a self-invoking command is a literal lookup, not a description-invoke. Surfaced live by going plugin-only on the authoring machine mid-review-loop.

## v5.1.1 — compound: claude clean-verdict counter-observation + set -e fallback trap

Patch release (`/compound`). Two load-on-demand reference additions from the IDEA-017 review-loop run — no body/rule bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/review-loop/references/common-review-findings.md` #22 — `set -euo pipefail` swallows a fallback placed as the final command.** A script's unconditional fallback/cleanup written as a bare final statement is skipped on its own failure (`set -e` exits first), emitting neither output nor fallback — classic in hooks/entrypoints whose contract is "always emit something". Fix: guard the fallible final command with `if ! cmd; then fallback; fi`. Provenance: a `SessionStart` plugin hook's final `jq` (PR #190).

### Changed

- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` § COUNTER-OBSERVATION + §Net-capability pointers.** Two independent data points against the established "claude never posts a positive clean verdict — clean always reads SILENT" claim: PR #190 (explicit-retrigger / `claude.yml` path) and PR #192 (PR-open auto-run / `claude-code-review.yml` push path) both posted a positive whole-review clean summary and read structurally CLEAN. Both paths → the push-vs-retrigger asymmetry hypothesis is weakened; most likely an upstream clean-path posting fix. The §Net-capability "never posts clean" assertions are flagged OUTDATED with forward-pointers. Net: claude can now usually be a CLEAN source, but SILENT-on-clean can still recur (open #1087), so don't make it the sole clean gate. Adapter safety unchanged (clean is already structural).

## v5.1.0 — IDEA-017: mind-vault as a Claude Code plugin (additive / coexist)

Minor release ([PR #190](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/190), IDEA-017). mind-vault gains a **native Claude Code plugin** install channel alongside the existing per-host symlink scripts — a fresh CC machine installs with one command (`/plugin marketplace add infohata/mind-vault` → `/plugin install mv@mind-vault`) and gets `/plugin` auto-update, instead of cloning the repo and running `setup-claude-code-symlinks.sh`. Additive and CC-only: the symlink path is unchanged, both coexist, pick one per machine. This is the adopter-surface widening the version bump reflects.

### Added

- **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `marketplace.json`** at repo root — repo root IS the plugin root, so `skills/`/`commands/`/`agents/` auto-discover. `name: mv` namespaces commands to `/mv:<cmd>` (coherent with the `mv-` subagent prefix); `displayName: Mind-Vault`; `version` mirrors the top CHANGELOG. Private install (no public marketplace). `claude plugin validate ./ --strict` passes.
- **Rule-loading on the plugin channel** — `commands/load-rules.md` (`/mv:load-rules`) is now channel-aware (resolves `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/rules/` on the plugin path, repo-relative on the symlink path, detect-and-warn if neither). A new `hooks/hooks.json` + `hooks/load-rules.sh` `SessionStart` hook **auto-injects** the always-on rule bodies via `additionalContext`, giving the plugin channel parity with the symlink channel's auto-loaded `~/.claude/rules/` (graceful fallback to a `/mv:load-rules` pointer note when jq/env/dir are unavailable).

### Changed

- **`/wrap` Step 4b generalised to multi-location version sync.** First-match-single-source → a PRIMARY (narrative) source plus N sync-required MIRROR sources bumped in lockstep, with a consistency-check gate (`plugin.json.version` == top CHANGELOG `## v`) that fires even when no bump happens. `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` is the first mirror; the mechanism is generic. `/compound` self-mode (`mind-vault-promotion.md`) patched to mirror-bump plugin.json too, so IDEA-less compound PRs don't trip the gate.
- **Best-effort double-load guard** in `setup-claude-code-symlinks.sh` — a light, non-fatal, one-directional (plugin-then-script) warning, with the `--plugin-dir`/`@skills-dir` dev-loop exempt. Symlink behaviour otherwise unchanged (coexist); non-CC host scripts untouched.
- **Docs** — README, AGENTS.md, and ONBOARDING gain the install-as-plugin path, the canonical `/mv:` namespacing note (skill triggers unaffected — description-invoked), the coexist note, and the `--plugin-dir` dev-loop. `rules/`/`docs/rules/`/statusline stated to stay script-wired on both channels.

### Removed

- **`agents/SKILL_CONTRACT.md` relocated to `skills/work/references/SKILL_CONTRACT.md`** so `agents/` holds exactly the 8 real `AGENT_*.md` — the plugin loads every `agents/*.md` as an agent, and a stray non-agent file would load as a bogus one (also fixed the same latent bug on the symlink path). ~13 referrers repointed per-depth; both gates pass (no stale path, every link resolves). Amends [IDEA-014](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/183).

## v5.0.5 — compound: claude slow-not-hung + two django-frontend traps

Patch release (`/compound`). A downstream sprint's cleanup-capstone review-loop session — three load-on-demand reference additions, no body/rule bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` § slow-not-hung.** claude's review legitimately runs much longer than bugbot/copilot (observed up to ~17 min on a large PR), so the multi-engine stall escape-hatch must NOT fire on elapsed wall-time alone. Before superseding a slow claude run: confirm genuinely-wedged via Actions-job *step progress* (not elapsed), re-fetch `find_claude_comments.sh` for a late-posted verdict first (claude posts near the end of the job), and keep claude's stall ceiling above its ~17-min worst case. Sourced from a real near-miss — a 17-min run escape-hatched as hung that then posted real findings immediately after (two findings lost to the loop, surfaced by a human). The § Failure-modes "claude stalled" row now points here.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/DELEGATED_HANDLER_STOPPROPAGATION_TRAP.md` (new).** A `@click.stop` / `onclick="event.stopPropagation()"` guard on a dropdown/kebab wrapper halts the bubble before it reaches `document`, so a document-delegated action handler inside (confirm-trigger, preview-open) never fires — the Delete click silently dead-ends. The guard is usually unnecessary too (the sibling open-handler is already `closest()`-scoped). Plus: drive click affordances with an Alpine click-toggle, never Bulma `is-hoverable` (hover-only → no feedback on click, dead on touch). Framed as the inverse of `LISTENER_REBIND_ON_SWAP`. SKILL.md References pointer added.

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SESSION_FILTER_PERSISTENCE.md` — resolver-scope + namespace-unity section.** A session-filter resolver whose `filter_keys` under-scopes the render fn's keys (most easily the `CHECKBOX_TOGGLE_KEYS` toggles) silently starves it — the symptom ("toggle does nothing on cold load") mis-points at the render fn when the bug is the resolver's scope. The resolver's `filter_keys` must be a **superset** of every key the render fn reads. Plus: per-entity toggle persistence must pass **one** `namespace` across the write path (workspace form) and the read path (param-less refresh partial), else the toggle persists on submit but evaporates on the next no-param re-fetch. SKILL.md pointer extended.

## v5.0.4 — IDEA-016: scripts/ + tools/ taxonomy (scoped re-partition)

Patch release ([PR #187](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/187), IDEA-016). Resolves the long-ambiguous `scripts/` vs `tools/` split (both held `install`/`setup`-named scripts) into three single-concern dirs, without churning the symlink wiring that IDEA-017 may dissolve.

### Changed

- **`tools/` is now runtime skill helpers + maintenance utilities only.** The review-loop adapters (`find_*`, `*_retrigger`), `sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh`, and `validate-skills.sh` stay; `statusline-command.sh` **moved in** from `scripts/` (it's invoked by Claude Code at runtime, not installation); `cleanup-contamination.sh` remains, honestly labelled a one-shot maintenance utility (not a runtime helper). Rewritten `tools/README.md` states the two-genre boundary. Runtime helpers deliberately did **not** move — zero reference repointing for the high-ref-count group.
- **`scripts/` is now host config-wiring only** (`setup-*-symlinks.sh` + `_symlink-lib.sh`). The `scripts/` → `link/` rename + `setup-*-symlinks.sh` renaming are **deferred to [IDEA-017](docs/ideas/IDEA-017-mind-vault-as-claude-code-plugin.md)** — a research spike (in the IDEA-016 archive) confirmed the CC plugin only **partially** dissolves `setup-claude-code-symlinks.sh` (`rules/`, `docs/rules/`, and the statusline + `settings.json` wiring have no plugin home → a residual CC script survives). New `scripts/README.md` documents the deferral.
- **Repointed the load-bearing statusline cross-wire** — `scripts/setup-claude-code-symlinks.sh:47` now links `mind-vault/tools/statusline-command.sh`. Plus README tree diagram, statusline prose, `skills/deployment/{SKILL.md,references/SHELL_INSTALLERS.md}`, `skills/review-loop/references/common-review-findings.md`, and `docs/guides/ONBOARDING.md`. Idempotency markers (`BEGIN mind-vault-aliases`, `disabled by install-cursor.sh`) left byte-identical; historical CHANGELOG entries + bare illustrative names left per convention.

### Added

- **`install/` (new dir) — machine provisioning.** The 7 `install-*.sh` (from `tools/`) + `install-wsl.ps1` (from `scripts/`), with a new `install/README.md`. Named `install/` (not `setup/`) to avoid colliding with the `setup-*-symlinks.sh` prefix that stays in `scripts/`. Every command example flipped `./tools/install-` → `./install/install-`. Migration followed [`RULE_rename-before-drop`](rules/RULE_rename-before-drop.md) (move+shim → repoint → green gate → drop shims → re-verify); dead-path gate = 0, `bash -n` clean. Architect-reviewed plan (🟡 → all 8 findings folded: broadened verification gate, statusline L47 cross-wire, honest `tools/` genre, refreshed IDEA frontmatter, Q4/Q5 added).

## v5.0.3 — validate-skills.sh CC-first + description-parser fix + progressive-disclosure guidance

Patch release ([PR #188](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/188)). Surfaced during IDEA-016 review when the OpenCode-era validator reported 6 skills "failing" — which proved to be a parser bug, not skill instability. Fixes the tool and compounds the lesson into the skill-authoring guide.

### Fixed

- **`tools/validate-skills.sh` description-length parser over-counted by reading past the closing `---`.** When `description` was the last frontmatter field, the next-field search scanned the whole file and counted everything up to the first body `word:` line (e.g. `status: complete` in a fenced YAML example) as description — inflating `work` to a reported 12492 chars (real: 308), `plan` 10371 (real: 384), `skill-writer` 1775 (real: <1024). Fix: bound the next-field search to within the frontmatter fence. Three of the six "failures" were pure parser artifacts and now pass even `--opencode`.

### Changed

- **`tools/validate-skills.sh` is now Claude-Code-first by default; OpenCode checks are opt-in via `--opencode`.** It was an OpenCode-era artifact enforcing OpenCode's ≤1024-char description cap + section-heading conventions on every run, so CC-first skills (rich descriptions, `## When to use` wording) false-failed. Default mode runs universal structural checks only (name, frontmatter, name↔dir, description present/non-empty); `--opencode` adds the fork-readiness checks back (see `docs/guides/AGENT_PORTABILITY.md`). Result: default `--all` = 21/21; `--opencode --all` = honest 18/3 (`land`/`sprint-auto`/`wrap` have genuinely >1024-char descriptions — a CC-irrelevant, OpenCode-fork-only concern).
- **`docs/guides/SKILL_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH.md` — the "500-line budget" section gains three refinements** (compounded from the above). (1) Progressive disclosure saves tokens **only** for minority-read content; splitting always-needed orchestration adds Read-tool overhead *and* risks function loss — net negative. (2) Measure the *real* number on both axes (`description` = always-loaded/expensive; body = fire-only/intermittent) with a trustworthy tool — a phantom metric nearly triggered a pointless debloat. (3) `skills/plan` (181L) is the exemplar: extracted the conditional 20% (`thin-input-bootstrap`, `architect-handoff`, `batching-for-sprint-auto`), kept the always-needed 80% inline. The line count is a smell to investigate, not a target to cut to.

## v5.0.2 — IDEA-018: prior-project provenance scrub + instruction-only scrub-gate guard

Patch release ([PR #186](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/186), IDEA-018). Closes the v5.0.1 known-follow-up: the pervasive pre-existing prior-project provenance presence is purged repo-wide (94 outside-archive hits → 0), and the gate that let it accumulate is hardened so it can't recur.

### Security

- **Purged a pervasive prior-project provenance identifier from all tracked files** — ~94 references across `CHANGELOG.md` (47), two SKILL bodies (`skills/compound`, `skills/idea`), the review-loop tool-script comments (`tools/find_{copilot,claude}_comments.sh`), `docs/guides/` (×2), `README.md` (×2), `docs/ideas/README.md`, and 11 archive IDEA/plan/session-note docs — generalised to neutral framing (foreign IDEA/PR numbers dropped; a bare `IDEA-149` would misread as a mind-vault IDEA). Compounded lessons and all mind-vault-own refs / module names preserved verbatim. Verified by a positive count-assertion gate (outside the IDEA-018 archive, zero remaining). Key finding: all 3 tool-script hits were **comments**, not functional defaults — `bash -n` clean. Real project names live only in local memory (`~/.claude`, never tracked).

### Changed

- **The `/compound` scrub gate (`skills/compound/SKILL.md` step 5) is now an instruction-only forcing function.** Rather than a hand-maintained regex/name-blacklist (whose false-positive cost outweighs its value and which ages badly), the gate makes the agent **emit a proper-noun classification** before commit — every token sorted `mind-vault-own | foreign→scrub | generic`. A gate satisfiable without emitting the classification is decorative. The gate's own example token was generalised to a `project-x` placeholder (with a note never to re-concretise it — the gate's own example is the highest-traffic re-leak vector). The regex is demoted to an optional cheap aid, explicitly not the enforcement mechanism.

### Added

- **`docs/archive/2026-06-idea-018-provenance-scrub/PROVENANCE_SCRUB_RUNBOOK.md`** — an archive-homed, *maintained* runbook for mind-vault's recurring provenance tidy-up: the inventory → categorise → generalise → verify procedure + a dated **run-log** (this scrub = run #1). Future drift = run the runbook and append a log entry, not a fresh IDEA per cleanup. The scrub gate points at it (by IDEA id) for the recurring-drift case. Architect-reviewed plan (🟡 → all 5 findings folded: positive-count gate, exact-count run-log, forcing-function guard, id-based pointer, mandatory blocking gate).

## v5.0.1 — compound: fail-closed bar for the data-isolation contract heading

Patch release — one learning compounded from the IDEA-014 Phase 2 review loop. No IDEA (no planning cycle); provenance is the date + PR.

### Security

- **Scrubbed a client-identifier leak from the v5 (IDEA-014 Phase 2) docs.** The Phase-2 wrap/work named a private adopter's org, repo, and author identifiers in tracked files — `skills/laravel/SKILL.md` (body), `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/ideas/README.md`, the Phase-2 plan doc, and an earlier IDEA archive line. All generalised to neutral framing ("a real ZF1→Laravel rework", "the legacy core", "the modern PoC repo") per the `/compound` customer-data scrub gate (mind-vault must be public-repo-safe). Real names remain only in local memory (`~/.claude`, never synced/tracked). _Known follow-up: a pervasive pre-existing prior-project provenance presence (~90 refs across CHANGELOG history, two SKILL bodies, and the review-loop tool scripts) is out of scope here — flagged for a dedicated scrub._

### Changed

- **`agents/SKILL_CONTRACT.md` — the "Data isolation / scoping boundary" heading gains a fail-closed bar.** During the Phase 2 review, **both** review engines independently converged on the same security flaw in the freshly-authored Laravel tenancy sample: the scope sample failed *open* (`if ($ctx) { …filter… }` with no `else` → no filter, every tenant's rows leaked) in any context where the context resolver is empty (queue worker, CLI, scheduler). The contract now states the bar for *every* stack that fills this heading: the canonical scope sample MUST fail closed (no caller/tenant context → zero rows, never an unscoped query). It's load-bearing because the same section always tells readers to *trust the scope* (removing the manual fallback) and an implicit-rewrite scope hides the open-fail. The contract is read in two voices, so one bar covers both: `mv-backend` fills the heading fail-closed; `mv-curator` asserts it and flags any context-gated filter with no zero-rows else. Cross-stack (Laravel global scopes, Django global managers, Rails default scopes) — and the two-engine convergence is itself the signal that a security-sensitive teaching sample is worth this bar.

## v5.0 — IDEA-014 Phase 2: demonstrated on a second stack (Laravel)

Major milestone ([PR #183](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/183), IDEA-014 Phase 2). Phase 1 (v4.9) *architected* the craft/stack split; **v5 proves it**. A second, structurally-different framework stack (Laravel) drops in by adding only `skills/` content — **with zero edits to any `agents/AGENT_*.md`**. The empty `agents/` diff is the deliverable: it distinguishes "genuinely stack-agnostic" from "Django with extra indirection". v5 now means *demonstrated on a second stack*, not merely designed. Content-correctness is closed by a fast-follow real-repo dogfood (a real ZF1→Laravel rework), shipping as v5.x — it follows v5, it doesn't gate it.

### Added

- **`skills/laravel/` — the Laravel backend stack skill.** A 239-line `SKILL.md` organised around the contract spine, exposing all **6 required `SKILL_CONTRACT` backend headings verbatim** (ORM eager-loading · Input-validation boundary · Background jobs · Data isolation / scoping boundary · Permissions/authorization · Testing conventions) plus the optional **Translation workflow** extra, each non-stub (mechanism + best-practice default + anti-pattern + a runnable sample). `VERSION`=`12` (framework), `metadata.version`=`0.1`. Seven references: `EAGER_LOADING`, `FORM_REQUESTS_RESOURCES`, `QUEUES_HORIZON`, `DATA_ISOLATION_TENANCY` (authored fresh — ecosystem gap), `POLICIES_GATES`, `PEST_TESTING`, `CONVENTIONS` (paraphrased Laravel Boost + Spatie guidelines, both MIT, behind a `Sources:` footer). Data-isolation carries the Django↔Laravel cross-direction warning (under-trust the implicit global scope vs. the create-path `tenant_id`-stamping gap); `preventLazyLoading` is framed as a Laravel-native superpower with no Django analog.
- **`skills/laravel-frontend/` — the Laravel frontend stack skill.** A 173-line `SKILL.md` exposing all **4 required frontend headings verbatim** (Reactivity model · Partial/fragment response · Component system · Form-submission lock), **baseline-first**: the default is plain server-rendered Blade + Vite + minimal vanilla JS (the real adopter's actual stack), with Livewire 4 and Inertia 2 as opt-in variant layers and Flux as a license-gated Livewire UI kit (Pro components flagged as a CI build gate). `VERSION`=`12`. Four references: `LIVEWIRE_LOADING_STATES`, `BLADE_FRAGMENTS_HTMX` (the Django `HTMXMixin` twin — the baseline deep-dive), `FLUX_LICENSE_GATING` (authored fresh), `INERTIA_PARTIAL_RELOADS`. The i18n client-data-path anti-pattern ("if you're caching translations in Redis, that's the smell") is carried on both skills.
- **Phase-2 verification log** (`docs/archive/2026-06-idea-014-stack-agnostic-agents/2026-06-07-phase2-verification-log.md`) — the structural proof, mirroring Phase 1's line-conservation log: empty `agents/` diff, all 10 contract headings resolving as non-stub `###` sections (anti-tautology awk gate — code fence + ≥8 non-blank lines per heading, zero `STUB!`), a **content-resolution dispatch dry-run** recording the one-line rule each generic agent extracts per heading (not mere string presence), and an explicit content-correctness residual so v5 doesn't over-claim.

The contract heading **strings are verbatim-identical to Django's** — they are the grep-resolved cross-stack interface; only the surrounding scaffolding differs. The heading floor was honoured without forcing an empty slot on Laravel. Both new skills are symlink-registered; `skills/work/references/persona-dispatch.md` already carried the `laravel` detection row (no edit needed). Architect-reviewed plan (🟢 SOUND); the two research-flagged unverified frontend idioms (Flux `<flux:button>`, Inertia `form.processing`) were verified against current docs before authoring — no `unverified` markers carried.

## v4.9.1 — compound: branch-currency forward-sync pre-flight in /wrap

Patch release — one learning compounded from the IDEA-014 Phase 1 sprint. No IDEA (no planning cycle); provenance is the date + PR.

### Added

- **`skills/wrap/references/BRANCH_CURRENCY_FORWARD_SYNC.md` + a Step-1 pre-flight stub** — a parked feature branch must be forward-synced (`git merge origin/main`, the `RULE_git-safety`-sanctioned direction) **before** `/wrap` runs Steps 3–4, which rewrite shared append-at-top files (`docs/ideas/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`/`DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`). The IDEA-014 branch was cut 5 commits behind `main`; finalizing docs on it would have placed the version section in the wrong reverse-chronological slot, drifted the ideas-index, and silently carried a pre-sibling `skills/django/SKILL.md` (which a merged sibling IDEA also edited) — all of which would have surfaced as merge conflicts at `/land`. The reference documents the three conflict classes (version-section ordering, ideas-index drift, shared source files) + a `git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/main` detection recipe. Pointer added to the wrap References list.

## v4.9 — IDEA-014 Phase 1: stack-agnostic agent architecture

Minor release ([PR #178](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/178), IDEA-014 Phase 1). The agent profiles stop being hard-wired to Django: each persona splits into a stack-agnostic craft core + a `## Stack adapter` that resolves concrete framework rules against the *active* stack skill, with a new contract doc defining the agent↔skill interface. Adopter-facing — a generic `mv-backend`/`mv-frontend`/`mv-curator` now works any stack that exposes the contract headings. **v5 stays reserved** for Phase 2 (the Laravel proving stack — the zero-agent-edit drop-in proof; v5 then means *demonstrated on a second stack*, not just architected).

### Added

- **`agents/SKILL_CONTRACT.md` — the agent↔framework-skill interface.** A required **6 backend + 4 frontend** contract-heading floor (ORM eager-loading · Input-validation boundary · Background jobs · Data isolation / scoping boundary · Permissions/authorization · Testing conventions; Reactivity model · Partial/fragment response · Component system · Form-submission lock), the optional-extras rule, the reviewers-consume-the-same-anchors note, a **fail-open contract** (unresolved stack → craft-only + announce the gap, never silently skip), and the `craft agent → framework-stack skill → language-base (python)` tiering invariant.
- **Stack resolution** in `skills/work/references/persona-dispatch.md` — `.claude/dispatch.md` `stack:` pin → `AGENTS.md` → auto-detect signals (django/laravel/node, with the `package.json`-resolves-frontend-only precedence rule) → ask once. No executable detector ships in Phase 1.
- **`scripts/statusline-command.sh` — 5-hour rolling rate-limit segment** (folded-in). Surfaces the 5h rate-limit window beside the existing 7d segment (same dim / yellow / red tier thresholds); also drops the 📌 prefix from the topic segment.

### Changed

- **All 8 `agents/AGENT_*.md` personas split into craft core + `## Stack adapter`.** The 4 stack-heavy profiles (`mv-backend`, `mv-frontend`, `mv-curator` — dual backend+frontend adapter, `mv-test-engineer`) had every Django/HTMX/Alpine mechanic replaced by a contract-heading pointer (`mv-curator` asserts the same anchors the authors fill); the 4 generic profiles (`mv-devops`, `mv-documentation`, `mv-researcher`, `mv-architect`) got a light adapter or a "stack-agnostic; no adapter needed" marker. The orphaned `**Stack profile:**` declaration lines were dropped (rename-before-drop sequencing).
- **`skills/django/SKILL.md` + `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` expose all 10 contract headings verbatim** (renames + 3 anchor stubs — Background jobs, Testing conventions, Input-validation boundary). No recipe content changed; Django behaviour is unchanged (the deterministic regression guard).

Deterministically verified by a line-conservation diff (every dropped stack-mechanic line maps to a contract heading; zero unaccounted removals — see `docs/archive/2026-06-idea-014-stack-agnostic-agents/2026-06-06-phase1-verification-log.md`). Architect-reviewed (🟡 → all 4 must-fixes folded). Shipped with rename-before-drop commit ordering (A contract+headings → B detection → C1–C4 per-profile splits → D generic light-touch → E drop orphaned lines).
## v4.8.1 — compound: git-mv inbound-link audit + markdown-formatter gotchas

Patch release — two learnings compounded from the IDEA-009 sprint (the `skills/python` extraction). No IDEA (no planning cycle); provenance is the date + PR. (2026-06-06, [#181](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/181))

### Changed

- **`RULE_self-sweep-before-push` rationale** § Contract-Change Sweep gains *"A file move / rename is a path-contract change — sweep BOTH directions"*: a `git mv` is a contract change where the path is the contract and **inbound links from sibling files are the callers**. The IDEA-009 lift `git mv`-ed an IDEA file to the archive dir; the in-loop link audit checked links *out of* the moved file but a sibling (`IDEA-014`) still linked to its OLD path and silently dangled — caught by the claude review a cycle later, when a pre-push inbound grep would have caught it free. Recipe now mandates both the outbound (`test -f` from the NEW dir) and inbound (grep the OLD path repo-wide) passes. Cross-ref added from the `RULE_rename-before-drop` rationale's "Relationship To Other Rules".

### Added

- **`skills/skill-writer/references/MARKDOWN_FORMATTER_GOTCHAS.md`** — constructs auto-formatters silently rewrite in a meaning-changing way. First entry: a literal `+`/`-`/`*` at the start of a wrapped prose line is a CommonMark list marker, so mdformat "canonicalises" it into a real list item (blank line + `+`→`-`), splitting the sentence — and it survives the formatter's idempotency check, so only a diff-read catches it. Surfaced during the IDEA-009 lift. Pointer added to the skill-writer References list.

## v4.8 — IDEA-009: skills/python base layer

Minor release ([PR #164](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/164), IDEA-009). Stands up a deliberate **language-base tier** beneath the framework-stack skills — adopter-facing: any Python project (django or not) now gets a `/python` skill for language-general engineering recipes, and the vault gains the correct home for future Python-general patterns instead of misfiling them under a framework skill by gravity. De-risks the `craft agent → framework skill → language-base skill` tiering that IDEA-014 ([PR #178](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/178)) builds on. (2026-06-06)

### Added

- **`skills/python/` — new language-base skill.** Base-layer framing (the deliberate home for patterns true of any Python project, beneath `django`/`django-frontend`) + a stack-resolution-aware TRIGGER/SKIP block: SKIP hands off to the repo's active framework skill (`django` today; `laravel`/etc. once IDEA-014's stack detection lands), so the vault's broadest false-positive surface doesn't double-load on framework tasks. Section headings deliberately avoid IDEA-014's reserved backend-contract slots.
- **Two Python-general references lifted into `skills/python/references/`** (via `git mv`, history preserved): `MODULE_SPLIT_AST_EXTRACTION.md` (byte-exact `ast`-driven flat-module → package split; owns the `RULE_rename-before-drop` forced-atomic-member sequencing) and `ENV_DRIVEN_ALLOWLISTS.md` (`frozenset`+env allowlist pattern). django-isms fenced as `Example (Django):` blocks; recipe mechanics unchanged.

### Changed

- **`skills/django/SKILL.md`** keeps discovery pointers (body env-stub + 2 References entries) now pointing at `../python/references/…` rather than copies — django consumers still find the recipes; the canonical home is `python`.
- **`docs/rules/RULE_rename-before-drop-rationale.md`** repointed from the old django path to `skills/python/references/MODULE_SPLIT_AST_EXTRACTION.md` (dependency inversion: `rule → python ← django`, uni-directional).

## v4.7.2 — review-loop: propagate the claude Phase-3-retrigger correction (§ A7)

Patch release — doc-consistency fix. The PR #169 self-dogfood correction (claude's `synchronize` auto-run skip-no-ops once it has already reviewed, so Phase 3 MUST explicitly fire `claude_retrigger.sh` for a fresh post-fix verdict) landed only in `engine-claude.md` § A7 and was never propagated to the two files an agent reads first — which still asserted the opposite ("claude Phase-3 slot is a no-op", "firing `claude_retrigger.sh` here would double-run"). An agent following the command doc or the sync contract therefore skipped the claude retrigger and read a stale verdict — surfaced by dogfooding `/review-loop` on PR #177. No IDEA (no planning cycle); provenance is the date + PR. (2026-06-06, [#180](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/180))

### Fixed

- **`commands/review-loop.md`** (2 sites) + **`skills/review-loop/references/multi-engine-sync.md`** (4 sites: the Claude-stalled escape-hatch row, the § Retrigger-discipline claude bullet + its closing summary line, and the add-a-new-engine note) now state the § A7 behaviour: claude IS retriggered in Phase 3 after a fix push (the auto-run skips post-first-review, so the explicit `@claude review` is the sole fresh verdict — no double-run race).
- **`skills/review-loop/SKILL.md`** Phase 3 step 4 gains an explicit "push-triggered engines (claude) are retriggered here too, not skipped" clause, removing the contradiction with the `multi-engine-sync.md § Retrigger discipline` section it cites.

## v4.7.1 — Tools: install-aliases.sh (fresh-machine shell + git aliases)

Patch release — a new `tools/install-*.sh` fresh-machine provisioner for Ubuntu-style shell convenience aliases (`ll`, `..`, `gs`, …) and a set of git aliases (`git st`, `git lg`, `git amend`, …). No IDEA (no planning cycle); provenance is the date + PR. (2026-06-06, [#177](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/177))

### Added

- **`tools/install-aliases.sh`** — installs two alias layers in one idempotent pass: shell aliases into a `# BEGIN/END mind-vault-aliases` marker block in `~/.bash_aliases` (with orphan detection and `~/.bashrc` source-wiring only when nothing already sources it), and git aliases via `git config --global` into the target user's `~/.gitconfig`. Follows `skills/deployment/references/SHELL_INSTALLERS.md`: `set -eo pipefail`, target-user resolution honouring `$SUDO_USER`, `chown user:` (primary group), `--check` with exit-code semantics, and `--no-shell` / `--no-git` opt-outs gated across every code path. Documented in `tools/README.md`.

## v4.7 — IDEA-015: split /wrap into /wrap + /land, retire the double-review

Minor release ([PR #176](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/176), IDEA-015). A structural reframe of the sprint-workflow finish: the merge stage gets its own skill and the review ceremony collapses from two passes to one. Adopter-facing — the canonical chain every project runs changes shape. (The stack-agnostic agent overhaul shipped as v4.9, IDEA-014 Phase 1; v5 now reserved for its Phase 2 Laravel proof.)

### Added

- **`skills/land/` — new merge + teardown skill.** Owns what `/wrap` used to do at its tail: Step 8 atomic squash-merge (non-protected targets; protected → hand back PR URL per `RULE_git-safety`), Step 5 post-merge worktree/volume teardown, and the `--integration <batch-iso>` sprint-auto batch teardown. Three auto-detected modes (`/land NNN` pre-merge = merge→teardown; `/land NNN` post-merge = teardown only; `/land --integration` = batch teardown). Opens with a **pre-merge-only precondition guard** that refuses to merge un-wrapped work (frontmatter `complete`? devlog present? index moved?). `ATOMIC_MERGE.md` + `WORKTREE_TEARDOWN.md` relocated here from `skills/wrap/references/`.

### Changed

- **Canonical workflow chain → single review:** `/idea → /plan → /work → /wrap (docs) → /review-loop → /land (merge) → /compound`. The double-review ceremony (deliverables pass before wrap, docs pass after) is retired — `/review-loop` already iterates to clean and triages code+doc findings identically, so one pass over the wrapped PR absorbs both. Reconciled across every chain depiction (README mermaid + skills table + sprint-auto row, SPRINT_WORKFLOW stage table, ONBOARDING stages, work/review-loop/plan skills + references).
- **`/wrap` is now docs-only** — finalizes docs and never merges/tears down (those moved to `/land`). Frontmatter description trimmed; SKILL.md 420→388L.
- **sprint-auto per-IDEA cadence collapsed** — S3–S7 two-pass (deliverables S3/S4 + docs S6/S7) → single S6 review pass after the S5 wrap; split 20/5 escalation caps merged to a single **20** (sized for the code long tail; doc findings caught by review-loop's own `no_progress_map`). Batch teardown call `/wrap --integration` → `/land --integration`. Integration-state review (S11.10) unchanged.

### Deprecated

- **`/wrap --scope=full`** — finalizes docs then emits a loud notice ("did NOT merge") and redirects to `/land NNN`. It no longer merges; the merge moved to `/land`. `--scope=docs` (default) and `--scope=idea-only` are unchanged.

Architect-reviewed twice (🟡→🟡, all findings folded — incl. the Phase-A/B boundary catch that drove the one-PR decision, and the merged-cap-=-20 code-long-tail sizing). Shipped as ONE PR with rename-before-drop commit ordering (C1 add /land → C2 sprint-auto cadence → C3 chain reconcile → C4 drop wrap legacy → C5 sweep). Supersedes [IDEA-013](docs/archive/2026-06-idea-013-wrap-readme-currency-backfill/IDEA-013-wrap-readme-currency-backfill.md)'s two-pass canonical chain; completes [IDEA-006](docs/archive/2026-05-idea-006-review-surface-collapse/IDEA-006-review-surface-collapse.md) (single review entry → single named merge entry) + [IDEA-008](docs/archive/2026-05-idea-008-wrap-doc-finalization-scope/IDEA-008-wrap-doc-finalization-scope.md) (`--scope` enum).

## v4.6.5 — compound: shell shared-style "fails open on a new surface" trap

Patch release (compound of a downstream app-shell surface migration). One frontend learning, extending an existing reference (no new file):

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SCSS_RESPONSIVE_PATTERNS.md` § 4 — shared rule via enumerated selector list / per-pane inline copy FAILS OPEN on a new surface.** A visual rule that must apply to *every* shell surface but is wired as a hand-maintained `.surfaceA-role, .surfaceB-role, … { … }` selector list OR a per-pane inline copy silently mis-styles any new surface that's not in the list / didn't copy the block — no error, no failed build, only a human's eyes catch it. Surfaced **twice in one session** migrating a single new surface (workspace-filter selects collapsed to content width; a card table-bleed reset missed → table overflowed on mobile). Fix: ONE base class surfaces opt into (`class="<surface>-x shell-x"`) or ONE mixin they `@include` — adoption is one token, impossible to "forget the list" because there's no list. Includes the base-class-vs-mixin decision (class when you control the element's class list; mixin for attribute/structural selectors), the smell (comma-list of `.<surface>-<role>` / same block pasted under ≥2 scopes), and a "which shared conventions must a new surface adopt?" checklist item for shell-surface additions. Generalizes the same single-source instinct as patterns 1 (mixin mechanic) + 3 (gutter-owner). SKILL.md References pointer extended.

## v4.6.4 — compound: claude-workflow anti-tampering generalization + stale-local-adapter fallback

Patch release (compound of a downstream dependabot + claude-engine arc). Two review-loop operational learnings, both extending existing references (no new files):

### Changed

- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude-onboarding.md` § anti-tampering bootstrap catch-22** — generalized from perms-only to **any edit** of the two claude workflow files. The byte-identity validation fires on an `actions/checkout` bump, a comment, or whitespace just as it does on a perms change; the **most common post-onboarding trigger is a dependabot workflow-action bump**. Spelled out the three consequences as a reusable rule: it can only land on the default branch (a feature-branch / consolidated-deps PR carrying it 401s → split it out), that PR's own Claude check red-✗es by design (merge through), and every active feature branch then red-✗es until it forward-syncs (a single default-branch workflow bump has a fan-out cost) — so weigh whether a cosmetic action-version bump is worth the dance.
- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md` § CWD gotcha** — added the **stale-local-adapter fallback**: when a project's committed `tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh` lags the canonical (mind-vault) version, run the canonical one against the project (`cd <project> && bash <mind-vault>/tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh <PR>`) rather than skipping the review — the project port can have a parser-capability gap (e.g. a pre-C1 claude adapter misses summary-body findings → false CLEAN). Belt-and-suspenders: read the raw `claude[bot]` summary-comment body + inline directly. Re-syncing the port is the durable fix; the canonical run unblocks the review now.

## v4.6.3 — ci: bump actions/checkout v4 → v6 in the claude review workflows

Patch release. Bumps `actions/checkout@v4 → v6` in the two claude-review workflow files — both the **asset templates** (`skills/review-loop/assets/claude.yml`, `claude-code-review.yml`) that projects port from, and mind-vault's **own live workflows** (`.github/workflows/`), which dogfood the engine. Keeps the canonical templates current with the deployed downstream version (where the same bump just landed) so future ports don't ship a stale v4. (2026-06-04)

### Changed

- **`actions/checkout@v4 → v6`** in `skills/review-loop/assets/claude.yml`, `skills/review-loop/assets/claude-code-review.yml`, `.github/workflows/claude.yml`, `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml`. ⚠️ Because the Claude review App validates the live workflow byte-for-byte against the default branch, **this PR's own `claude-review` check fails by design** (the PR head no longer matches the current `main` baseline — the documented anti-tampering bootstrap, whose 401 says "this is normal and you should ignore this error"). Safe to merge through; `main` becomes the new v6 baseline on merge.

## v4.6.2 — compound: claude-engine summary-body findings (C1) + taxonomy-shell review patterns

Patch release (compound of a downstream KB-taxonomy-shell-migration PR's review loop). Headline is the **C1 claude-engine fix**: the adapter only parsed inline comments + a clean-substring, so claude's `## Code review` summary-BODY findings (CLAUDE.md convention violations, cross-file security notes it can't line-anchor) were **invisible to the loop** — calibrated and fixed against 13 real `claude[bot]` summary bodies on one PR. The other five are reference additions/corrections surfaced by the same loop. (2026-06-03)

### Fixed

- **`tools/find_claude_comments.sh` — surface findings-bearing summary BODIES (C1).** Confirmed-on-real-data calibration: summary login is `claude[bot]`; heading is literally `## Code review` (old `code-review` signature missed the space → whole summary unrecognized); clean is **whole-review** (positive phrase AND no structural finding marker — `privilege`/`escalation`/`security` keywords false-positive on clean prose that names the concepts it checked, so markers are structural: `missing|violation|❌|#### |### [0-9]`); skip-no-op bodies (draft / already-reviewed) filtered by the heading-then-`Skipped` shape. A non-clean summary now emits a finding block carrying `(comment id <cid>, review summary)` and counts toward `VERDICT_READABLE`. Re-validated against all 13 downstream bodies: **3 NOOP / 9 FINDINGS / 1 CLEAN, zero false-cleans** (the first-pass "2 NOOP / 10" was an off-by-one miscount; all three `Skipped` bodies are genuine no-ops). **Hardened by a self-dogfood** (`/review-loop 169 claude` on this very PR) which caught two real bugs in C1's own calibration: (1) `CLAUDE_NOOP_PATTERNS` was unanchored — a findings body whose prose said "already reviewed" was false-filtered as a no-op → fixed by anchoring to the `## Code review`→`Skipped` shape with `re.MULTILINE`; (2) the marker list missed claude's "One issue found." + `` ### `file`  `` shape → **inverted the surface decision to catch-everything** (`findings = posted ∧ ¬provably-clean`, marker-independent) so claude's non-deterministic review format can never read SILENT. Documented in `skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md` § calibration update — findings live in the SUMMARY BODY.

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SCRIPT_TAG_JSON_ESCAPING.md`** (C4) — server-rendered JSON in a `<script>` block is stored-XSS (`mark_safe(json.dumps(...))` doesn't escape `<`/`>`/`&`); fix via one shared `escape_seed_json`/`json_script` helper; sweep ALL sibling views, not just the flagged one.
- **`skills/django/references/PERMISSION_GATE_PROBE.md` § Gate the GET render path** (C3) — a shell edit-form fragment's GET render is a third gate beyond endpoint-POST + affordance-hide: a deep-linked non-editor gets an editable form then a 403-on-save unless the render path mirrors the POST gate.

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/PREVIEW_DRAWER_URL_STACK.md` § Template hrefs use `{% url %}`** (C2/C6) — corrects the mis-stated "shell hrefs must be literal" lesson: Django-template fragment hrefs use `{% url 'app:entity_form_fragment' pk %}`; only the JS-consumed `URL_PATTERN_BY_TYPE` map stays literal (no `reverse()` browser-side). The original bug was a wrong route name, not the tag; `{% url %}` and the literal render byte-identical (so the convention is **not** test-verifiable — the guide is the authority).
- **`skills/review-loop/references/LARGE_PR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.md`** (C5) — second observed-evidence paragraph: a 3-engine loop's per-engine clean is not the gate's clean (wait-for-slowest + adapter-surfaces-the-finding-shape, then still do the independent pass); ties to the C1 adapter-blindspot.
- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md` § Calibration discipline** (self-compound, generalized from the #169 claude self-dogfood) — three cross-engine adapter rules: (1) the surface decision is **catch-everything / marker-independent** (`findings = posted ∧ ¬provably-clean`) because engine output format is non-deterministic; (2) **dogfood the adapter on a PR that exercises its own finding-shape** (a synthetic test feeds your assumed format); (3) **validate calibration against the full real corpus**, not the count a summary claims. Plus an anti-pattern: ❌ surfacing findings only on a known-marker match (→ false-SILENT on a new format).
- **`engine-claude.md` + `claude_retrigger.sh` — CORRECTED claude's retrigger model** (the #169 re-review experiment). Proven: the push auto-run produces a review **only the first time**; once claude has posted a review, every subsequent push **auto-skips** ("Skipping review — already posted"), and only an **explicit `@claude review`** forces a fresh one (in the @-mention/task format, a 3rd output shape the catch-everything classifier handles). This **reverses** the prior "the push IS the retrigger, Phase 3 doesn't double-fire" guidance — Phase 3 MUST explicitly retrigger claude after a fix push once it has reviewed. Also fixed two minor adapter findings from claude's own fresh review: title extraction skips the constant "Code review" heading (`^#{3,6}` / first non-review heading); `\bmissing\b`/`\bviolation\b` word-boundaries on the finding markers.

## v4.6.1 — /wrap Step 6b: whole-README currency audit + two-pass workflow doc reconciliation

Patch release (IDEA-013). Closes the gap where `/wrap`'s Step 6 only greps the README for the *current* IDEA's changed identifiers, so the README-as-a-whole drifts across many IDEAs (version framing, counts, feature tables, stale ⚠️ flags) with no single wrap responsible for its currency — the README equivalent of the CHANGELOG/devlog backfill-gap rule Step 4 already had. Architect-reviewed (🟡 REQUIRES ABSTRACTION → all 6 must-fixes folded). First dogfood landed in-branch; this wrap's own re-audit then caught a stale `commands/` count (7→6) the first dogfood missed — the feature catching drift on the same file that introduced it. (2026-06-03, [#168](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/168))

### Added

- **`skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 6b — whole-README currency audit** (staleness-gated, conditional). Eligible under `--scope=docs`/`--scope=full`, **skipped under `--scope=idea-only`** (sprint-auto's batch wrap is the cohort's audit point). A `<!-- wrap:readme-currency-audited YYYY-MM-DD -->` marker anchors staleness — deliberately **not** file mtime, so a Step-6 partial touch of the README doesn't reset the whole-file audit clock. Fires when ≥N (default 5) base-branch PRs merged since the last audit; a marker dated today ⇒ count 0 ⇒ skip (the `docs`→`full` two-pass idempotency guard); future-dated/skewed marker ⇒ treat as stale. Findings inherit Step 6's patch-now-mechanical vs flag-follow-up dispositions.
- **`skills/wrap/references/README_CURRENCY.md`** (load-on-demand) — the Step-6b probe checklist (version framing vs Step-4b `VER_SOURCE`, counts vs filesystem globs, feature-table completeness, stale-flag verification, command surface), marker mechanics, the **fail-loud rule** for unknown count shapes (a heuristic count-probe that can't map a project's surface discloses a no-op rather than silently passing), the `gh`-down **calendar-staleness fallback** (marker absent or >30 days), the optional per-project hint block, and the sprint-auto asymmetry.

### Changed

- **Two-pass workflow ordering promoted to canonical** across the headline surfaces — `work → review (deliverables) → wrap → review (docs) → compound`. Both mermaid diagrams (README + `docs/guides/SPRINT_WORKFLOW.md`), the README/ONBOARDING glyph chains, the SPRINT_WORKFLOW stages table, and `WRAP_BEFORE_REVIEW.md`'s "default chain" framing previously showed the legacy single-review-pass order, which contradicted the wrap-before-review discipline the skill bodies already enforce. Because every sprint IDEA is doc-heavy (IDEA + plan + devlog), the two-pass path is canonical, not an exception.
- **`skills/wrap/SKILL.md` frontmatter `description:`** now names the whole-README currency audit (Step 6b), so the capability is discoverable from the skill's trigger surface. `references/WRAP_BEFORE_REVIEW.md` pass-1 enumeration includes 6b.

### Fixed

- **Stale README `commands/` count** (`7` → `6`) — the `/bugbot-loop` + `/copilot-loop` command wrappers were deleted in IDEA-006 (v4.3), leaving 6 files in `commands/`; the README's "review/PR/utility entries" count hadn't been updated. Caught by Step 6b's own dogfood re-audit during this wrap.

## v4.6 — Claude Code Review as a third review-loop engine

Minor release (IDEA-012). Adds `claude` — `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` running the `code-review` plugin (installed via `/install-github-app`, PR #166) — as a first-class `/review-loop` engine alongside Cursor Bugbot and GitHub Copilot, and generalizes the sync contract 2→N. It is the first **auto-trigger / comment-anchored** adapter: unlike the managed *Claude Code Review* App, the action + plugin posts **no named check-run** (review-state synthesizes from the GitHub **Actions job** of the `claude-code-review` workflow) and **no stateful review** (findings are buffered inline comments; clean requires a POSTED clean summary — a `success` run that posts nothing is treated as uncertain/`#1087`, never auto-cleaned). Architect-reviewed (🟡 REQUIRES ABSTRACTION → all 8 findings resolved). Clean path validated via a `claude`-solo dogfood on this PR (no-verdict runs held RUNNING then surfaced as `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT`, settle 180s). **Findings-path VALIDATED downstream on a non-draft code PR** — a real review posted (a "Code review" summary comment + inline findings) under identity **`claude[bot]`** (the dogfood's `github-actions[bot]` was a clean-run artifact — it had posted nothing — now corrected in `engine-claude.md`). **Decisive finding: claude posts NOTHING on a DRAFT PR** (the run fires + concludes `success` but no review is posted → reads SILENT); every earlier "ran but posted nothing" result was the draft no-op, *not* `#1087` (a separate, rarer bug). Un-drafting the PR auto-fired a full posted review on the same commit. **Hardened from a downstream investigation that surfaced two distinct failure layers** (verified against primary `anthropics/claude-code-action` issues): **LAYER 1 (auth/setup)** — ship write-perm + fork-guarded / author-gated workflow templates at onboarding (`assets/claude-code-review.yml` + `assets/claude.yml` + `references/engine-claude-onboarding.md`) instead of `/install-github-app`'s read-only default (read-only silently blocks posting → false CLEAN), plus the default-branch OIDC anti-tampering bootstrap catch-22; **LAYER 2 (`success` but posts nothing, open bug #1087)** — workflow reliability fixes (pin `@v1.0.133`, `classify_inline_comments:false`, `use_sticky_comment:true`, `claude_args` + a prompt forcing a posted summary so the review publishes *during* the run, bypassing the broken post-session capture) **and** the adapter inversion (clean now needs a posted clean summary; a silent run emits `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT` and is held non-DONE, never the old zero-inline false-CLEAN). Also: forward thread auto-resolve wired into review-loop Phase 3 + an adapter-contract `thread <PRRT_…>` field; settle fallback `600`→`180`. Robust-mode alternative (managed Code Review App, check-run annotations independent of the comment buffer) recorded for persistent-#1087 escalation. (2026-06-02, [#167](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/167))

### Added

- **`tools/find_claude_comments.sh` + `tools/claude_retrigger.sh`** — the claude adapter. `find_*` synthesizes `CLAUDE_CHECKRUN` from the Actions run (latest by `run_started_at`), parses buffered inline comments (login-only filter on `CLAUDE_LOGINS` — posting identity is `claude[bot]`, with `github-actions[bot]`/`claude-code-action[bot]` as over-coverage; login-only is the safe direction for inline — a too-strict body-signature would filter a real finding out → false CLEAN), and probes reachability (`CLAUDE_NOT_INSTALLED` → self-exclude from the default set). **Clean requires a POSITIVE posted signal (LAYER 2):** a posted clean summary + zero inline findings; a `completed` run with no readable verdict is held RUNNING (`CLAUDE_REVIEW_PENDING` within the 180s settle, `CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT` after) so the orchestrator's "DONE + zero findings = CLEAN" can't fire on a #1087 silent drop — the old zero-inline auto-CLEAN arm is removed. `CONCLUSION` is never consulted (claude concludes `success` even with findings). `claude_retrigger.sh` is a bootstrap-fallback only — claude is **push-triggered** (the `synchronize` auto-run is the retrigger; Phase 3 skips it).
- **`skills/review-loop/assets/claude-code-review.yml` + `assets/claude.yml`** — canonical onboarding workflow templates (commit to the DEFAULT branch, not `/install-github-app`'s read-only default): write perms, fork-PR guard, author-association gate, and the LAYER-2 reliability fixes (pinned `@v1.0.133`, `classify_inline_comments:false`, `use_sticky_comment:true`, `claude_args --allowedTools`, final-action-post prompt). mind-vault's own `.github/workflows/` updated to match (activates on merge per the anti-tamper rule). **`references/engine-claude-onboarding.md`** — four-step setup + the bootstrap catch-22.
- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-claude.md`** — adapter reference, leads with the action-vs-managed-App trap, documents the push-triggered/comment-anchored model + `/install-github-app` onboarding hint + a first-run-calibration log (identity + `actions:read` confirmed on PR #167; shared-`pull_request_review_id` + body-signature pending in a consuming project).

### Changed

- **`claude` joins the default engine set** (`bugbot,copilot,claude`), reachability-gated — it self-excludes on repos where the action workflow isn't installed, so a bare `/review-loop` doesn't block to HUNG; an explicit `claude` degrades loudly. `commands/review-loop.md` + `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` enums updated; stale `max_active_work_minutes` (180→240) + the obsolete ≥5-min retrigger-spacing line corrected.
- **`dual-engine-sync.md` → `multi-engine-sync.md`** (per `RULE_rename-before-drop`), plus `dual-engine` → `multi-engine` renamed **project-wide** (term + path) across live docs, CHANGELOG, and archive — only the IDEA-012 plan's rename-action descriptions keep the old name as the rename source. Added claude's escape-hatch rows, scratch slots, push-triggered retrigger no-op, and a 3-engine asymmetric-clearance template.
- **Draft-until-review cadence** (`work` + `review-loop` + `sprint-auto` SKILLs) — `/work` opens PRs **draft** (the push-triggered claude engine would otherwise bill a review on every WIP commit); `/review-loop` un-drafts (`gh pr ready`) pre-flight before Phase 1 so claude reviews the finalized state once. Plus an adapter belt-and-suspenders: `find_claude_comments.sh` emits **`CLAUDE_DRAFT_NOOP`** + early-exits on a draft PR, so a skipped un-draft surfaces "no verdict until ready" rather than a misattributed SILENT.
- **`engine-adapter-contract.md`** — new "auto-trigger / comment-anchored" adapter category (claude its first instance); widened the `<ENGINE>` enumeration + `last_seen_<engine>_signal_id` taxonomy (synthesized summary-comment-id anchor). **Compounded two cross-cutting engine lessons** into the contract (generic, not claude-only): § Identity — *calibrate identity/behavior off a run that actually posted the signal, never a no-op* (the dogfood mis-confirmed `github-actions[bot]` off an empty run); § Adapter categories — *auto-trigger engines may no-op on draft PRs + bill per commit* → the draft guard + un-draft cadence.
- **`skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md`** — `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE` validation accepts any non-empty CSV subset of `{bugbot,copilot,claude}` (+ `none`). **`skills/compound/references/review-finding-ingest.md`** — `.claude-loop/` run-artifact path + engine inference + `--claude-file` alias. README + `docs/guides/{GIT_WORKFLOW,SPRINT_WORKFLOW,ONBOARDING}.md` add Claude as the third engine.

## v4.5.1 — Compound: discard-guard data-shape check, drop-vs-ensure lifecycle, wrap breadcrumb cleanup

Patch release — `/compound` of three learnings from a search-index dimension-migration session (a destructive index-drop + a resilient read path). No IDEA; provenance is the date + PR. (2026-06-01, [#165](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/165))

### Changed

- **`RULE_self-sweep-before-push` trigger 3 (defensive-code sweep) extended** — a guard that *skips/discards* rows is itself a data-shape claim. Added the facet: validate a discard/skip guard against the producer's REAL data, not a mock (mocks encode your assumption and pass; so does an architecture review reading the same assumption). A wrong guard silently drops *every* row — worse than the bug it prevents. Grep the producer's write site; if a sibling reader already decodes the shape, copy it; if the data is composite/encoded, decode — don't reject.
- **`skills/wrap` Step 3 (re-sort the ideas index) extended** — on completion, also remove the originating `_(IDEA-NNN moved to In Progress …)_` breadcrumb left in the old priority tier (resetting the tier to `_(none)_` if it empties — the index keeps the full tier skeleton, never drops a header). Skipping it is silent rot — stale "moved to In Progress" stubs accumulate and falsely read as active backlog.

### Added

- **`skills/django/references/RESOURCE_LIFECYCLE_DROP_VS_ENSURE.md`** (load-on-demand) — a destructive op (drop/clear/purge an index, cache, table, bucket, scratch dir) silently undoes itself unless you audit EVERY re-creation path: lazy ensure-on-use, first-use create, deploy/bootstrap ensure. Re-point them at the new target or guard them; prove with a post-drop *read*, not "delete was called". Pointer added to `skills/django/SKILL.md` References.

## v4.5 — Agent profiles → recognized Claude Code subagent schema + cross-harness portability

Minor release — the first IDEA-driven (non-compound) release since the v4.4 patch line began. The eight `agents/AGENT_*.md` personas were carrying **OpenCode-style** frontmatter (`mode`/`temperature`/`tools`-map/`allowed_tools`, no `name:`) and so registered **degraded or not at all** as dispatchable Claude Code `subagent_type`s — silently weakening the dispatch substrate that five of the six sprint-workflow skills route through. IDEA-011 re-authors them to the recognized schema and adds a cross-harness portability methodology. (2026-06-01, [#163](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/163))

### Changed

- **All eight `agents/AGENT_*.md` profiles re-authored to the recognized CC subagent schema** — namespaced `name: mv-<persona>` (collision-safe in the shared subagent registry), rich `description:` with `<example>` trigger blocks (drives correct auto-dispatch), comma-string `tools:`, `model: inherit`, `color:`. **Persona bodies unchanged** — this is a schema/registration refactor, not a behaviour rewrite. Filenames stay `AGENT_*.md` (CC dispatches on the frontmatter `name:`, not the filename — so no rename, `RULE_rename-before-drop` doesn't bind, and the `~/.claude/agents/` + `.cursor/agents/` symlinks + every `agents/AGENT_*.md` doc-link stay valid).
- **Per-role tool-grant audit** (not blanket-copied from the old uniform map): `mv-curator` is review-only (no `Write`/`Edit` — `Bash`/`Grep` for inspection like `git diff HEAD`); `mv-researcher` **gains `WebFetch`/`WebSearch`** (it was webless despite being the external-scout persona). The dual-mode `mv-architect` keeps `Write`/`Edit` (author in `/work`, reviewer in `/plan`); `mv-documentation` keeps `Bash` (Prime Directive 4 interrogates `git log`/`git diff` when authoring changelogs).
- **Dispatch sites point at the `mv-*` ids** — `skills/work/SKILL.md` matrix, `skills/work/references/persona-dispatch.md` (now carries the canonical *persona ↔ subagent_type ↔ profile-file* map as the single source of truth), and `skills/plan/references/architect-handoff.md` (`subagent_type: mv-architect`). Conceptual prose elsewhere keeps the `AGENT_*` display names; file-path links unchanged.
- **`docs/guides/CURSOR_SETUP.md`** — Cursor-discovered names shift `AGENT_*` → `mv-*`; documents that `model: inherit` is what makes the same file work unchanged in both Claude Code and Cursor (no fork).

### Added

- **`docs/guides/AGENT_PORTABILITY.md`** — cross-harness agent-profile methodology (the user's added requirement, framed as a fork-and-fix doc, not a generator — honouring the IDEA non-goal). Web-verified compatibility matrix: **Cursor** = straight copy (already symlinked via `.cursor/agents/`; works because of all-inherit), **OpenCode** = fork (boolean `tools` map + provider-prefixed `model`), **Antigravity** = fork (prose `## Name (@handle)` sections in `.agents/agents.md`, no per-file format). Includes worked before/after fork recipes for OpenCode + Antigravity, a downstream-consumer safety note (file-links unchanged + unknown `subagent_type` degrades to inline persona-read), and a regenerate-after-body-change note. Indexed in `docs/README.md`.
- **`skills/review-loop/references/COSMETIC_NONCONVERGENCE.md`** — `/compound` of this PR's own review loop: knowing when to stop fixing a non-converging review engine. (1) **Adopt-don't-fight** — when an engine flags the same convention gap across cycles, codify the convention or accept the valid point in one edit, never a third instance-level reword. (2) **Asymmetric hard-stop** — when the substance engine (Bugbot) is clean for several SHAs while a prose-sensitive engine (Copilot) emits one cosmetic nit per cycle, hard-stop on the substance gate and hand back residual cosmetic findings as Tier-3. The Phase-4 no-progress guard now counts repeated same-category cosmetic-prose nits as a hand-back trigger.

### Removed

- The OpenCode-only `mode:` / `temperature:` / `allowed_tools:` frontmatter keys from all eight profiles (superseded by the CC `tools:` comma-string + `model:` keys).

## v4.4.6 — Compound: shell-swap lifecycle (pre/post-swap re-init · persisted-toggle reset) + wrap-rewrite-not-stale-marker + large-PR independent review

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_WIDGET_LIFECYCLE.md` § 7 — **don't (re-)init a swapped region from a plain `HX-Trigger` custom event; it fires PRE-swap.** HTMX dispatches plain `HX-Trigger` events before the swap (only `-After-Swap` / `-After-Settle` fire post-swap), so a re-init driven by the custom trigger reads the old, not-yet-replaced DOM and the real swap then lands with nothing to boot it. Tell: a sibling widget wired to `htmx:afterSwap` works while the trigger-wired one is half-dead. Fix: re-init on `htmx:afterSwap` scoped to the swap-target id (§1) + `htmx:beforeSwap` teardown (§3). Compounded from a consuming project (chat session-switch left a dead token meter + send button when re-booting off a `shellSurfaceChanged` HX-Trigger). (2026-05-31)
- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_WIDGET_LIFECYCLE.md` § 3 extension — reset swap-surviving persisted UI state in teardown. A `sessionStorage`-seeded toggle survives a cold reload but desyncs across an in-shell fragment swap (new component reads persisted `true` while the swapped DOM mounts collapsed → two-click toggle); reset the persisted key on `htmx:beforeSwap` so the swapped-in component mounts with state and DOM in agreement. Compounded from a consuming project (ctxdraw open-state). (2026-05-31)
- **Changed** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 6 downstream-docs dispositions — **a ⚠️-stale marker is NOT a disposition.** When the IDEA's own migration made a reference section describe a now-dead architecture, rewrite that section for the new architecture in the wrap rather than dropping a "stale, see IDEA-NNN" banner that leaves the reference actively wrong and defers the real work to an IDEA that may never run. The rewrite is bounded (you just shipped the new shape) and rides the same wrap commit the engines review. Compounded from a consuming project (user: "let's properly rewrite the guides + AI reference docs, don't just mark them stale"). (2026-05-31)
- **Added** `skills/review-loop/references/LARGE_PR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW.md` — a single fast-bot CLEAN pass on a very large PR (≥~25 commits / ~2k net lines / high-blast-radius surface) is necessary-not-sufficient. At hand-back, escalate to an independent two-lens deep review (correctness/security + architecture/convention/doc-accuracy subagents) on the net `<base>...HEAD` diff before declaring merge-ready; fold findings back as a fresh fix cycle. Compounded from a consuming project's PR: Bugbot cleared a ~50-commit / ~8k-line PR in one pass; the independent two-lens review found a teardown stale-callback race, a 403-vs-404 record-enumeration leak, and a never-wired skeleton with a misleading docstring.

## v4.4.5 — Compound: refresh-signal discipline + shared-map / msgctxt i18n routing

Patch release. `/compound` of five review-loop learnings from a file-manager shell-migration build on a downstream project. Two targeted extends to already-referenced docs — no new files, no SKILL.md-body or `rules/` additions.

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_PATTERNS.md`** — three sections on the `entityChanged`/refresh-signal lifecycle, sitting next to the existing consumer-side modal-scoping gate: (1) **producer-side gate** — a shared mutation-response helper must emit the change-signal only when state actually changed, never on validation-failure / no-op / zero-affected paths (else every refresh-walker + in-place section refresh fires spuriously during an error state; gate on the `success` value; test that the no-op path omits the trigger header); (2) **bridge a foreign success event into the canonical signal** — re-dispatch `entityChanged` so a new affordance inherits the existing walker's URL/scroll/rebind rather than a bespoke fetch+swap, plus the caveat that bit (a consumer resolving its target via `document.querySelector('.shared-class')` reads the WRONG node once a second instance of that class appears — scope the lookup to the owning container; adding a second instance of a widget class is a contract change → grep the class's query sites); (3) **defer destructive UI-state clears to the async success event** — clearing a selection store synchronously with `requestSubmit()` loses it on a failed request; move the clear to `htmx:afterRequest` gated on `detail.successful`, scoped to the submitting form.
- **`skills/django/references/I18N_WORKFLOW.md`** — two additions to the map-ownership section: (1) **SHARED map beats N-way duplication for genuinely-shared strings** — `all_trans = SHARED + <that-app>.py` means a SHARED entry fills every catalog; a label rendered from a *different* app's template (e.g. a nav label whose `{% translate %}` lives in the core/shared knowledge-menu partial) extracts to a catalog the per-app map never fills → silent English-fallback in every locale until moved to SHARED; (2) **`msgctxt` is invisible to a msgid-keyed fill** — maps key on the msgid string alone, so one entry fills both the contextless and the `context`-qualified occurrences, AND a context-only string still needs its plain-msgid entry in a map that reaches its catalog.

### Fixed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_PATTERNS.md`** — corrected a pre-existing broken cross-link in the modal-scoping section: `DJANGO_FORM_INVALID_STATUS.md` → `FORM_INVALID_STATUS.md` (the actual filename, matching every other reference to that doc).

## v4.4.4 — Compound: invitation-shell-migration leftovers (bulk-ORM model-layer bypass · in-place-replace scroll preservation · sub-entity presentation tier · affordance-gate dual · e2e relative-URL)

Patch release. `/compound` of five leftover learnings from an unbounded-sub-entity shell-migration build on a downstream project. (Consolidates two earlier-overlapping compound passes that both targeted v4.4.4 — the bulk-ORM/`auto_now` learning was deduped to a single, fuller reference.) Routed load-on-demand — three new references, three targeted extends, no SKILL.md-body mechanics or always-on `rules/` bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/django/references/BULK_ORM_BYPASSES_MODEL_LAYER.md`** — `QuerySet.update()` / `bulk_create` / `bulk_update` issue SQL directly and skip the model layer: no `save()`, no `pre_save`/`post_save` signals (reindex, cache-bust, audit, counters), no `auto_now`/`auto_now_add`. The classic silent bug is a `.update(status=…)` leaving `updated_at` frozen — fix by setting it explicitly (`bulk_update` also needs the `auto_now` field assigned per-instance AND listed in `fields=`). Covers the three honest options when a skipped signal is load-bearing, the reviewer/self-sweep grep (`auto_now`, `def save(`, `@receiver(post_save`) for any diff introducing a bulk op, and when bypassing is exactly right.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SUB_ENTITY_PRESENTATION_TIER.md`** — the dashboard-sub-entity presentation decision in a shell migration, driven by one property (bounded vs unbounded): **bounded** → inline preview-drawer drilldown, no standalone surface; **unbounded/historical** → a bounded teaser (an *actionable* slice — actionable-state-always + recently-changed-within-a-window + omit decayed-noise + per-identity priority, **not** `queryset[:N]`) plus a dedicated filterable centre sub-surface at an additive URL. Sub-surface conventions: additive (bookmark-survival-safe) URL, keep `active_surface` on the parent, reuse the mutation service verbatim, one uniform permission selector across teaser/surface/row-actions.

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_SCROLL_PRESERVATION.md`** — added the sibling scenario the doc previously punted on: **scroll preservation across an in-place *replace* refresh** (a list/section re-rendered via `outerHTML`/`innerHTML` after delete-a-row / refresh-on-event, where the browser resets `scrollTop` to 0). Capture-before / rAF-restore-after on the resolved inner scroll container, one universal `document.body` listener, same-logical-content-only gate; three robustness notes (rAF before restore so layout settles; resolve the inner `overflow-y:auto` pane not `window`; universal beneficiary not per-surface copy).
- **`skills/django/references/PERMISSION_GATE_PROBE.md`** — added "The dual — server-gated but the affordance still leaks": the complement to checklist #4. The endpoint is correctly gated but the UI affordance renders for everyone (non-admins see actions that 403 on click). The reliable smell is a permission flag (`can_admin`) passed into a render-fn "for signature symmetry" but never threaded to the template — a dead param *and* a guarantee the affordance is ungated. Fix: thread it to the template context (gate at the same selector as the endpoint) **or** drop the param; gate the endpoint (security boundary) AND the affordance (UX boundary) off the one selector.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/MULTI_TENANT_PLAYWRIGHT.md`** — added an anti-pattern: never hardcode a host in a `to_have_url` assertion. Assert a relative path (Playwright resolves it against the context `base_url`); a literal host is doubly wrong in multi-tenant tests where the configured `base_url` differs from the dev box AND the `Host` header *is* the tenant identity — relative paths are the only base-URL- and tenant-agnostic form. Examples stay generic.
- **`skills/django/SKILL.md`** — bulk-update caveat at the ORM-optimization example + References pointer for `BULK_ORM_BYPASSES_MODEL_LAYER.md`; affordance-dual note on the permission-gate-probe entry.
- **`skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md`** — References pointers for `SUB_ENTITY_PRESENTATION_TIER.md` + the `HTMX_SCROLL_PRESERVATION.md` description refreshed to name both scenarios.

## v4.4.3 — Compound: mobile edge-affordance rails (JS/UX/architecture half) + wrap-before-review discoverability cue

Patch release. `/compound` of the JS/UX/architecture learnings from the same mobile edge-affordance build whose SCSS slice shipped in v4.4.2, plus one workflow-positioning fix. Deduped hard against the existing corpus (the SCSS mechanics already live in `SCSS_RESPONSIVE_PATTERNS.md` — everything cross-refs it, nothing restates it); routed load-on-demand — one new reference, four targeted extends, no always-on `rules/` bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/mobile-ux-polish/references/EDGE_AFFORDANCE_RAILS.md`** (the skill's first reference file) — adding an edge-affordance rail to a tuned scroll-snap shell, three facets: **(1) decouple the chrome from the snap engine** — render it `position: fixed` OUTSIDE the snap container instead of mutating snap geometry (`scroll-padding` / negative-margin / `clip-path`) which would risk the tuned settle logic; the no-`stopPropagation` corollary; the **iOS Safari fixed-in-transformed-ancestor trap** (place after `</main>` where no transform/filter ancestor exists); concrete z-index ladder discipline. **(2) the adjacent-pane reveal model** — each rail reveals only the pane adjacent to the active pane in that direction (centre → up to two reveal rails; a side pane → one "back to centre" rail); content-gated neighbour (`previewSurface.depth > 0`); re-fire the reveal on replace-while-open. **(3) ship the static affordance, defer the animated one** — the build-vs-defer heuristic + the pulse-chevron cost ledger (first-visible state machine + `localStorage` seen-flag that throws in Safari private mode + mark-seen semantics).

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md`** (gotcha 8) — added a subsection on the **`MutationObserver`-mirror** variant: when a late-initialising consumer has no native event of its own to read the active-discriminator inside, the (init-seed + `paneChanged`-event) shape races on cold load (the event fires before the consumer subscribes, so it stays stuck on the stale default); mirror the authority's `data-*` attribute via `MutationObserver` instead — an event-mirror is not an SSOT, the attribute is.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_STORE_COORDINATORS.md`** — added "When NOT to promote to a store — the inbound-command CustomEvent bridge": triggering a component-**scoped** method from an element outside its `x-data` subtree via a symmetric command-in (`init()` document listener → `this.scopedMethod`) / state-out (existing emit) pair, vs leaking the method to global store scope.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/APP_SHELL_LAYOUT.md`** ("Where elements live") — added the **edge-affordance-lip reserved-gutter** placement doctrine: a fixed edge affordance occupies a reserved gutter (never overlays edge-to-edge content); permanent gutter on the always-present side, gated gutter on the conditional side (reflow masked by the open-animation).
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SCSS_RESPONSIVE_PATTERNS.md`** — added the bidirectional backref to its placement-doctrine (`APP_SHELL_LAYOUT`) and JS/UX (`EDGE_AFFORDANCE_RAILS`) counterparts, closing the cross-ref loop on the v4.4.2 file.
- **`skills/mobile-ux-polish/SKILL.md`** — new References section pointing at `EDGE_AFFORDANCE_RAILS.md` + a new Anti-patterns line (static-over-stateful-animated affordance).
- **`skills/review-loop/SKILL.md`** — **wrap-before-review discoverability cue**: a pre-flight note in the entry preamble + a References bullet telling the agent to run `/wrap` (`--scope=docs` default, which structurally cannot reach merge) on a doc-heavy / IDEA PR BEFORE triggering engines. The capability already existed (`skills/wrap/references/WRAP_BEFORE_REVIEW.md`) and sprint-auto already sequenced it for the automated path — the gap was purely that nothing cued the **manual** `idea → plan → work → /review-loop` path. No mechanics restated; both insertions point at the canonical reference.
- **`skills/wrap/SKILL.md`** — reciprocal "When to use" trigger bullet for the pre-review manual path (run me before review, not only before merge).
- **`skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md`** — References-list descriptions refreshed for the three extended references.

## v4.4.2 — Compound: SCSS responsive patterns (`@extend`-across-`@media` · responsive custom-property token · additive-padding collapse)

Patch release. `/compound` of three cohesive SCSS/CSS-architecture learnings from a mobile edge-affordance build on a downstream project (a mobile control mirroring a desktop drawer edge-control). All routed to one load-on-demand reference — no SKILL.md body or always-on `rules/` bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SCSS_RESPONSIVE_PATTERNS.md`** — three patterns for "shared styling that differs at a breakpoint": (1) **`@extend` cannot cross a `@media` boundary** — `@extend %placeholder` from inside a media query errors ("You may not @extend selectors across media queries"); use a `@mixin` + `@include` instead, because `@extend` groups selectors onto one block and cross-media scopes can't be grouped. Plus the **compiler-path-masking trap**: a permissive dev build (`make static` / libsass) can silently tolerate it while a stricter e2e/CI dart-sass recompile hard-errors — verify on the strict compiler before push. (2) **Cascading CSS custom property** on the root with a `@media` override as the single source for a footprint consumed by ≥2 components (drawer padding + lip width + pane gutter), beating scattered per-component media queries. (3) **Additive-padding collapse** — nested padded containers stack their horizontal padding and crush content on a narrow pane; designate one gutter owner (the outermost edge-defining element) and zero every nested layer's horizontal padding at the constrained breakpoint.
- One pointer added to `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` References list (after the SCSS vendor-import entry).

## v4.4.1 — shell + multi-tenant compound (schema-context · context-key · OOB-filter · own-key persistence)

Patch release. `/compound` of four learnings from a settings-hub-with-filters shell migration on a downstream multi-tenant project, plus one git-workflow learning folded in from a session self-evaluation. All routed to references (load-on-demand) — no SKILL.md body or always-on `rules/` bloat.

### Added

- **`skills/django/references/MULTI_TENANT.md`** — "A `public-schema` wrapper NULLS the ambient tenant" section: a render/response fn that calls `get_current_tenant()` *inside* a `with_public_schema()` / `schema_context("public")` block reads `None`, so a tenant-keyed `get_object_or_404` raises a spurious **404** that masks the intended status (e.g. a form re-render that should be 422). Enclose only the shared-model work; render after the block closes. Sibling to the existing "pass explicit tenant over ambient connection state" section (this is the inverse — the wrapper actively nulls the tenant).
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/APP_SHELL_LAYOUT.md`** — two sections: (1) **"Shell-global context keys are reserved"** — a surface fragment view reusing a shell-global key (`nav_items` for `<c-nav-bar :items>`) clobbers the global component prop → `{% url '' %}` / `NoReverseMatch` crash; namespace per-surface keys (`<surface>_nav_items`). (2) **"Settings-hub nav WITH per-section filters"** — when a settings-hub workspace carries per-section filters, keep section nav a bare `hx-get` → `.shell-center` + OOB-swap *only* the filter region; a full shell-fragment re-render re-mounts and re-animates the drawer on every click.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SESSION_FILTER_PERSISTENCE.md`** — **"A surface persisting its OWN key is not cross-entity bleed"**: own-`<surface>_filters_<org>` persistence is correct (per-entity pattern); the anti-pattern is *reading* another family's `cross_filters_<org>`. The gate is "read only the keys you own", not "no session persistence" — a clarification for reviewers who flag any session-persisted filter as a bleed.
- **`docs/rules/RULE_git-safety-rationale.md`** — "Stacked-PR merge order — absorption vs sibling-collapse" section: when handing back multiple open PRs, check `baseRefName` first. Siblings (`base = main`) merge in any order, auto-collapse. A *stacked* child (`base = parent's branch`) folds **into** the parent (absorption) → parent becomes the superset → merge parent to `main` as one shipping moment. Don't frame stacked PRs as siblings ("parent first, then child") — that's backwards and leaves the human confused when nothing collapses.

## v4.4 — sprint-auto v3.2 doc-migration + `/wrap --integration` mode (sprint-auto flagged UNSTABLE)

Minor release. A multi-dimensional review of the `sprint-auto` skill (6 reviewers → per-finding adversarial refutation, ~39% over-flag pruned — the IDEA-010 Step-2.5 discipline applied to a skill audit) found the v3.2 logic core sound but the **documentation surface riddled with un-migrated v3.1 drift**: stale references to mechanisms v3.2 deleted (forward-sync S11.11, per-PR re-review S11.12) or inverted (draft + auto-closed `[INTEGRATION]` PR → non-draft + open merge gate; last-of-batch `/wrap NNN` teardown → `/wrap --integration`). One finding was a real cross-skill contract break: the `/wrap --integration` teardown mode the docs handed off to **did not exist**. This release completes the migration and adds the missing mode. The follow-up was anticipated — IDEA-010's archive README flagged it.

### Added

- **`/wrap --integration <batch-iso>` batch-teardown mode** (`skills/wrap/SKILL.md` + `references/WORKTREE_TEARDOWN.md`) — a distinct post-merge invocation (not a `--scope` value) that, after the human merges the single `[INTEGRATION]` PR, tears down the integration worktree + branch + every per-IDEA `auto/<slug>` worktree/branch in one shot. Closes the dangling reference sprint-auto + `integration-stage.md` both pointed at. The v3.1 last-of-batch `/wrap NNN` auto-detection is demoted to a clearly-labelled fallback (it doesn't fit v3.2, where per-IDEA PRs auto-close on integration merge).

### Changed

- **sprint-auto v3.1→v3.2 doc migration completed** across `SKILL.md`, `references/post-pr-sequence.md`, `references/escalation-policy.md`, `references/worktree-lifecycle.md`, `references/integration-conflict-resolutions.md`, and `assets/auto-run-log-template.md`: `[INTEGRATION]` PR is non-draft + the open merge gate (never auto-closed); forward-sync (S11.11) + per-PR re-review (S11.12) references removed from all current-facing tables/diagrams/templates; the "pick ONE PR / forward-sync" morning-merge model replaced with "merge the `[INTEGRATION]` PR; per-IDEA PRs auto-close as ancestors".
- **Escalation caps canonicalised to `20/5/10/10/20/5`** (deliverables/docs/union/full/integration/compound) — dropped the deleted `5 re-review` cap; `escalation-policy.md` is now the single 6-cap authority; per-IDEA max corrected 30→25.
- **`IDEA_integration_branch.md`** gained a top-of-file SUPERSEDED-by-v3.2 banner (retained as the v3.1 design record).
- **`skills/plan/references/batching-for-sprint-auto.md`** eligibility corrected: explicit-arg-only (no scan mode), `auto_safe: true` OR `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true`, `sensitive_paths_cleared` as a conditional override (not a blanket key).
- **README**: `sprint-auto` row de-staled (one shared integration stack, caps `20/5/10/10/20/5`, v3.2 merge-gate) and flagged **⚠️ unstable**, with a top-level stability callout.

### Note

- **`sprint-auto` is flagged UNSTABLE.** Docs are now v3.2-coherent, but the runtime path hasn't been exercised end-to-end since v3.2 + multi-engine review + eval-gate + two-pass `/wrap` landed. Shake down on a low-stakes batch before trusting it unattended. The single-IDEA flow is unaffected.

## v4.3.14 — IDEA-010: retroactive audit hardening (adversarial-verify STILL-REAL) + mind-vault stale-thread cleanup

Patch release on the v4.3 line. Dogfooding the v4.3.13 `THREAD_AUTO_RESOLVE` retroactive recipe against mind-vault's own ~250-thread / 17-PR Copilot pile exposed that a single-pass Explore-agent audit **systematically over-flags STILL-REAL** — 5 of 5 hand-checked verdicts were false positives (an accurate past-tense CHANGELOG ref read as dead; an `<img>` already in a code span read as live HTML; a contract "contradiction" the next line reconciles; "absence semantics undefined" that two adjacent lines define; a "see below" cross-ref absent from the file). Because the recipe gated bulk-resolve on raw STILL-REAL count, those phantoms would have blocked a safe cleanup or shipped a noisy false punch list. The hardening adds a second, adversarial opinion before any STILL-REAL gates the resolve; the operational half then cleared the whole pile.

### Added

- **`THREAD_AUTO_RESOLVE.md` Step 2.5 — adversarially verify every STILL-REAL.** Each first-pass STILL-REAL is independently re-checked by a refuter agent prompted to REFUTE (default-to-false-positive; flip to CONFIRMED only on verbatim evidence). Only confirmed survivors gate bulk-resolve or reach the punch list. Same high-confidence-before-mutation model the forward (Pattern 1) recipe already relies on, applied to the retroactive half. Re-run on mind-vault's pile collapsed ~27 first-pass STILL-REAL to **4 confirmed** (~85% over-flag caught).
- **Shared-worktree read hazard note** (`THREAD_AUTO_RESOLVE.md` Step 2): audit/refute agents must read post-merge code via `git show <ref>:<path>`, never `git checkout` — observed an audit agent check out `main` and switch the parent session's branch mid-run.

### Changed

- **Bulk-resolve gate retargeted to *confirmed* STILL-REAL** (Step 3 + "when NOT to fire" #1 + intro Pattern-2 summary) — gating on raw first-pass verdicts is what over-blocks.
- **README counts corrected**: Skills (15)→(17) — added the missing `review-loop` + `mobile-ux-polish` rows; Agents (9)→(8) — removed the stale `bugbot / copilot` row (those AGENT files were deleted in IDEA-006/v4.3; review is now via `/review-loop` + engine references).

### Fixed

- **`scripts/install-wsl.ps1`** (3 confirmed findings from PR #120): set TLS 1.2 before the kernel-MSI `Invoke-WebRequest` (Win10 + PS 5.1 default rejects Azure blob); consult `$vmMonitor` in the virtualization warning (previously computed but unused — *not* a hard gate, to avoid the Hyper-V-owns-VT-x false negative); trim `-Distro` so a whitespace-only value routes to the picker instead of `wsl --install -d "   "`. PowerShell not runtime-testable here — needs a Win10 smoke test.
- **`skills/sprint-auto/references/post-pr-sequence.md`** S15 diagram listed "forward-sync results, re-review results" that v3.2 deleted (S11.11/S11.12) — dropped (box-border width preserved).

### Operational

- **Resolved 250 stale Copilot review threads across 17 merged PRs** via the hardened recipe (audit → Step 2.5 refute → bulk-resolve at a human-confirm gate). The cohort now reads 0 unresolved Copilot threads.

## v4.3.13 — Compound: review-loop thread auto-resolve (forward Phase-3 mutation + retroactive audit-then-bulk-resolve recipe)

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` of a single high-leverage pattern surfaced when a downstream sprint cohort accumulated 129 stale Copilot review threads across 11 PRs over ~1 week of activity. GitHub's review-thread `isResolved` state is independent of the underlying code state — when the review-loop applies a fix in Phase 2 and pushes in Phase 3, the inline thread stays unresolved until a human clicks "Resolve conversation". Without this pattern, the noise accumulates fast — and hides the real signal (the few threads that ARE actually live).

### Added

- **`skills/review-loop/references/THREAD_AUTO_RESOLVE.md`** (new) — closes review threads in step with the fixes. Two paired patterns: (1) **Forward (in-loop) auto-resolve** — adapter captures thread node ID at Phase 1 ingest (alongside the existing `comment id` + `review` staleness tags), Phase 3 fires `resolveReviewThread` GraphQL mutations for findings the same-cycle commit closed; (2) **Retroactive audit + bulk-resolve** — inventory unresolved threads via GraphQL sweep, dispatch an Explore-class agent to verify each thread against current code (FIXED / STILL-REAL / WON'T-FIX-CONVENTION / DOC-DRIFT / UNCERTAIN classification), bulk-resolve only on zero-STILL-REAL verdict. Includes the primitive (the `resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: ...})` mutation + the thread-vs-comment ID-shape trap), the REST-vs-GraphQL bot-login split (GraphQL `author.login` drops the `[bot]` suffix the REST payload carries) handled by a `sub("\\[bot\\]$"; "")`-normalised thread-author filter that matches either representation, per-tier auto-resolve decision matrix, when-NOT-to-fire conditions (partial fix; human reply in thread; engine still `RUNNING`; STILL-REAL count > 0; UNCERTAIN > 10%), adapter contract additions (bot identity + one-thread-per-finding + reply-support flags engine references should declare), and a "don't comment on each PR" anti-pattern note (the comments would recreate the noise the resolve clears). Pointer added to `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` References.

## v4.3.12 — Compound: six recurring shell-form-migration offenders (form theming + nav scope discipline + help_text wrapper + HTMX 422 swap + ModelForm `_post_clean` trap + drawer coordinator vs parent x-data)

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` of six distinct anti-patterns surfaced during a downstream shell-form migration's M-walk + review-loop cycle. Two are net-new references (form-rendering shape selection + `_post_clean` instance-mutation trap); three extend existing references with adjacent-pattern sections. Together these close the most common silent-fail modes in Django + HTMX shell forms.

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/FORM_RENDERING_PATTERNS.md`** (new) — Bulma form-rendering shape selector + the trap. Three valid shapes: `{% crispy form %}` (preferred; `BaseModelForm` autoloads `Layout(*self.fields.keys())` + crispy-bulma applies full chrome), manual `<input class="input">` markup (custom-layout forms with dynamic rows / conditional Alpine reveal / Django built-ins like `PasswordChangeForm` whose widget attrs can't be injected), bare `{{ form.field }}` with widget-attrs class injection (compromise; per-widget maintenance — every new field needs `attrs={'class': 'input'}` and ChoiceField doesn't cleanly work). The trap: bare `{{ form.field }}` inside Bulma-shaped wrappers WITHOUT widget classes — renders unstyled native HTML; the wrapper LOOKS correct so diff review misses it. Plus the Django help_text wrapper trap: `<ul>` inside `<p class="help">` is invalid HTML, browser lifts `<ul>` outside, defeats any `.field .help` selector. Default to `<div class="help">` when help_text may carry block-level HTML (PasswordChangeForm, password validators, admin custom widgets). Shape-selection table + render-and-assert vs visual-regression vs manual-eval testing mechanics. Pointer added to `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` References.

- **`skills/django/references/MODELFORM_POST_CLEAN_TRAP.md`** (new) — Django's `ModelForm.is_valid()` calls `_post_clean()` which calls `construct_instance(self, self.instance, …)`, writing every cleaned field's value INTO `self.instance`. Code that reads `request.user.field` AFTER `is_valid()` to compare against `cleaned_data['field']` always finds them equal — the change-detection collapses to always-False. `form.changed_data` doesn't help either: smart-default `__init__` patterns (auto-populating `self.initial['language']` from the request locale when user has no saved preference) make changed_data diverge from saved-instance change in both directions. Fix: snapshot the field's saved value BEFORE binding the form. Bites locale switching (the surfacing case: `HX-Refresh` branch should fire on language change but never did), audit logs, cache invalidation, side-effect emails, webhook dispatch. Test-reproducible — set up the form, assert instance mutates on `is_valid()`. Adjacent: model-layer `FieldTracker` libraries for genuinely complex multi-field change-detection. Pointer added to `skills/django/SKILL.md` References.

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/DATA_ATTR_NAV_CONVENTION.md`** — appended § *Scope discipline: cross-surface marker vs in-surface raw `hx-*`*. `data-shell-nav-link` is the CROSS-SURFACE marker — clicking it semantically means "change which app surface I'm looking at"; handler swaps full `#shell-swap-target` (workspace + centre) via `outerHTML` because workspace BELONGS to the new surface. For IN-SURFACE affordances (filter forms, section nav within a settings hub, tab strips, sub-section switchers), `data-shell-nav-link` is the wrong tool — produces the "workspace flash" recurring offender: every in-surface click re-renders the workspace, replaying its entry animation. Correct in-surface pattern: raw `hx-*` on the link targeting the specific centre region with `hx-swap="innerHTML"`. Server emits an `HX-Trigger` event (e.g. `sectionChanged`) carrying the new sub-state slug; workspace's inline `<script>` listens, updates `is-active` class + `aria-current` on the matching link without re-rendering. Visual M-walk catcher: sentinel attribute on the workspace partial must survive the click.

- **`skills/django/references/FORM_INVALID_STATUS.md`** — appended § *Client side — HTMX won't swap 422 by default*. Once the server returns `HttpResponse(body, status=422)` on validation failure (Option 1 in the existing reference), there's a paired CLIENT-side requirement easy to miss: HTMX's default non-2xx handling does NOT swap the response body, just dispatches `htmx:responseError`. Symptom: form silently fails, console fills with `POST … 422 (Unknown Status)`, generic error toast fires, field-level errors never render. Fix: global `htmx:beforeSwap` listener that sets `event.detail.shouldSwap = true` + `event.detail.isError = false` when status === 422. Five lines, parse-time registration, covers every form-fragment endpoint project-wide. Three-piece wiring checklist (server 422 + client beforeSwap listener + form template `hx-target`) — any one missing produces silent-fail in a different way.

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_STORE_COORDINATORS.md`** — appended § *Anti-pattern — sibling `x-data` vars are NOT coordinator-store proxies*. Recurring trap: shell template declares `Alpine.store('drawerCoordinator')` (which the drawer cotton's `shellDrawer` factory registers into via `register(name, edge, instance)`) AND parent-scope `<main x-data="{ workspaceOpen: true }">` variables that LOOK like drawer visibility state. They are NOT — they're sibling variables, unconnected to the drawer's actual `isOpen` field. Mutating `workspaceOpen = false` from an `@click` doesn't close the drawer; the drawer's coordinator-tracked `isOpen` is unchanged. Fix: use `Alpine.store('drawerCoordinator').closeByName(name)` / `.openByName(name)` directly — the coordinator API is the single source of truth for the resource it coordinates. Diagnosis recipe + when parent-scope `workspaceOpen` IS the right answer (layout signals, NOT drawer-state proxies). Generalisable: any `Alpine.store(coordinator)` store that has sibling parent-scope variables shares the trap.

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/FORMS_INDEX.md`** (new) + cross-skill dedupe — a single discoverability index covering form work across both skills (rendering / status+swap / validation / formsets / uploads / FK validation / filter forms / drawer state / submit ergonomics / form-adjacent i18n). Replaces the per-ref multi-sentence summaries in both `django/SKILL.md` and `django-frontend/SKILL.md` References blocks with terse one-liners + a single umbrella pointer per skill — form work is now discoverable from either side without a grep. Paired trim of `FORM_INVALID_STATUS.md` (189 → 106 lines): collapsed the recommended-against Option 2 (gate on response body content), promoted the `HX-Trigger` gate from Option 3 to Option 2, consolidated the dual anti-pattern lists, dropped the "why this trap is recurring" recap. No behaviour or rule change.

### Why these six together

All six surfaced in the same downstream PR's review cycle — each one independently is the kind of bug that takes a 30-minute debug session to root-cause from "code looks right, doesn't work". Promoting all six in one compound:

- Each is **cross-project** (any Django + HTMX shell project can hit them).
- Each is **non-obvious** (the code looks correct at first read; the bug is one level down).
- Each has a **clean fix** the reference codifies (rather than a "be careful" warning).
- Together they cover the most common silent-fail modes when migrating forms to shell + HTMX.

The references-first (not bodies) placement keeps SKILL.md token costs flat (only short pointer lines added); the actual mechanics live in references and load on demand when the consuming skill is invoked.

## v4.3.11 — Compound: listener rebind on swap + scroll-spy patterns + hyphenate narrow labels + i18n singular/plural collision + Add-X gender-agreement sidestep

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` of five reusable learnings from a downstream cross-surface UI density restyle (filled-bg badges + section-card cotton primitive + always-plural section labels + Lithuanian terminology unification). Two of the five are **third-recurrence** patterns (htmx:afterSwap rebind + `hyphens: auto`), promoted from "ad-hoc fix" to standalone references.

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/LISTENER_REBIND_ON_SWAP.md`** (new) — per-container / per-pane JavaScript listeners (not document-delegated) that die silently when their binding element gets `outerHTML`-swapped. Distinct from `HTMX_WIDGET_LIFECYCLE` §6 (widget re-mount inside a swap target via synthetic events) — this reference is about the *listener* dying when its *binding element* is swapped. Three-axis rebind contract: listen on `document`, gate by `evt.detail.target` (don't rebind on every swap), idempotent rebind (dataset marker / WeakSet so synthetic-fires-twice doesn't attach a second listener). DOM `scroll` doesn't bubble — document delegation isn't a sidestep for scroll listeners. 3rd-recurrence across three independent surfaces of the same shell-architecture project (tag-filter pill click handler / navbar scroll-hide / sticky section-nav scroll-spy). Includes the **adjacent failure mode**: scroll container ownership after a naive flex-stretch fix — listener IS bound to the pane parent, but the user's scroll happens elsewhere because a child element claimed `overflow-y: auto` (fix: `flex: 1 0 auto; min-height: 100%` on the stretching child, keep the overflow on the pane). Pointer added to `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` References.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/SCROLL_SPY_PATTERNS.md`** (new) — two non-obvious gotchas for keeping an in-page "active section" indicator in sync with scroll position. (1) `IntersectionObserver` flickers because `entries` only carries targets whose intersection ratio JUST changed; picking "best from entries" bounces non-deterministically at threshold crossings. Replacement: rAF-throttled scroll handler that reads ALL targets every frame — monotonic, layout-stable, performance comparable to IO for typical chip counts. (2) Any conditional CSS property that affects intrinsic width (font-weight, padding, letter-spacing, font-style, font-size, text-transform on some font families) ripples sibling positions during scroll-spy — toggling active mid-scroll re-flows the strip. Fix: color-only differentiation for active state (color / background-color / box-shadow / outline / opacity are layout-safe; everything else is suspect). Same-axis pre-reservation (invisible `::before` pseudo-element pre-claiming the heaviest variant) is the escape hatch when emphasis truly needs more weight. Pointer added to `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` References.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/HYPHENATE_NARROW_LABELS.md`** (new) — `hyphens: auto` + vendor prefixes + `overflow-wrap: break-word` for text labels in shell chrome / table headers / nav buttons that squeeze visibly on narrow viewports (320-480px) in inflected languages (Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, German, etc. — typically 1.3-1.6× longer than English source + uppercase adding 5-15% via wider glyph metrics). Browser dictionary keyed off `<html lang="...">` — set the lang attribute correctly per locale or hyphenation never fires. `overflow-wrap: break-word` is the fallback for browsers that don't have a dictionary for the active locale. 3rd-recurrence pattern across table column headers / workspace nav labels / sticky chip labels — promoted to standalone reference. Pointer added to `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` References.

### Changed

- **`skills/django/references/I18N_WORKFLOW.md`** — three new sections covering the i18n surface of an inflected-language UI:
  - § *GNU gettext singular/plural hash collision* — `gettext()` and `ngettext()` use different hash keys in the `.mo` file; a singular lookup against a plural-only entry does NOT fall back to `msgstr[0]`, it falls back to the source English. Failure mode: a `{% blocktrans count counter=N %}Noun{% plural %}Nouns{% endblocktrans %}` refactor merges the pre-existing singular `msgid "Noun"` into the plural entry; dozens of `{% trans "Noun" %}` and `_("Noun")` callers in models / forms / table headers silently render English in non-English locales. Symptom: count-bearing section headers translate (the blocktrans finds the plural entry), but the same noun as a standalone column header / `verbose_name` does not. Fix: drop the blocktrans, use always-plural `{% trans 'Nouns' %}` with a count separator (` · N`) rendered separately — modern UI convention, gettext-clean. Alternative: `msgctxt "count"` disambiguation if the project's fill-script pipeline has msgctxt awareness. Diagnostic recipe + extraction-warning canary.
  - § *Always-plural button labels — use the verb form to sidestep adjective-noun gender agreement* — `{% trans "New scope" %}` requires every target locale to express adjective-noun gender agreement; the moment two parallel translations choose different gendered nouns for the same English source (e.g. lt `aprėptis` feminine vs `objektas` masculine for *scope* / *property*), the adjective `Nauja…` / `Naujas…` diverges visibly. Verb form `{% trans "Add X" %}` (matching the established `Add Domain` convention) sidesteps the inflection entirely — verb invariant, noun takes accusative case (which translators' reflex handles automatically). When NOT to apply: chat-specific UX vocabulary (start-fresh semantic), page titles/headings, single-word affordances (`+ New`). Migration discipline: rename triggers a FORCE_SYNC_MSGIDS audit (see next section).
  - § *FORCE_SYNC stale msgid after rename* — when a translation map key is renamed, `FORCE_SYNC_MSGIDS` (typically in `shared.py`) needs the new key. A stale entry pointing at the renamed-away key silently no-ops: the fill script's `all_trans.get('OldKey')` lookup finds nothing; the force-sync exits without writing. Future canonical-value edits to the new key don't propagate. Compounds with the earlier "force-sync N entries" telemetry trap — N is the count of set members, not the count actually overwritten. Audit recipe + fold into `RULE_rename-before-drop` sequence.
  - § *Adjacent: the CSS-side rescue* — pointer cross-reference to `../../django-frontend/references/HYPHENATE_NARROW_LABELS.md` for the layout-side complement when labels can't be shortened further.

## v4.3.10 — Compound: HTMX synthetic-swap widget rebind + permission-gate probe + i18n view-toast ownership

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` of three reusable learnings from a downstream
CBV → shell-render-fn/fragment surface migration.

### Added

- **`skills/django/references/PERMISSION_GATE_PROBE.md`** (new) — when re-implementing a view's authorization in a new place (HTMX fragment / second endpoint / management command / task), replicate the view's **effective** gate (the AND of `permission_classes` + `get_queryset` + `dispatch`/`get_object`), not the coarse declared permission class — copying the class alone silently **widens** the gate. Covers the divergence example (per-object `dispatch` check + cross-tenant `get_queryset` scoping both narrower than the class), the inverse case (a legacy gate authorizing on *historical authorship* — `author == request.user` — is a bug to fix, not copy: re-gate the legacy endpoint too + migrate the tests that pinned it), and the UI-bypass-test mandate (hiding an affordance ≠ authorization). Pointer added to `skills/django/SKILL.md` References.

### Changed

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_WIDGET_LIFECYCLE.md`** — new §6 *Synthetic swap events from a custom body-replacer (drawer / preview surface)*: the **binder-side** rule for (re-)mounting widgets when a body-replacer (drawer / preview surface) swaps the DOM via `innerHTML` and dispatches the lifecycle events itself. A binder must get **three independent axes** right or it dies *silently* in the drawer (works on cold load + real swaps, **latent across surfaces**): (1) listen on an event the replacer actually fires — commonly `htmx:afterSettle`/`htmx:load`, often **not** `afterSwap`; (2) bind on `document`, not `document.body` (a `document`-dispatched event never reaches a `body` listener); (3) read `evt.detail.elt || evt.detail.target` (replacers commonly set `elt`, real swaps set `target`) — or ignore detail and rescan idempotently. Presents the two dispatch shapes in the wild neutrally (`document`-dispatch + `elt`, vs element-dispatch + `bubbles` + both keys per `PREVIEW_DRAWER_URL_STACK.md` / `DRAWER_FORM_STATE_PRESERVATION.md`, now cross-linked) — the binder rule is correct under both. §2 idempotency covers the synthetic-fires-twice case.
- **`skills/django/references/I18N_WORKFLOW.md`** — added the view-emitted-toast instance to the *Logical-ownership traps* list: a `_()` / `messages.*` toast emitted from a view in app-A *about* an app-B entity extracts to **app-A**'s catalog (the `gettext` call-site app is the authority, not the entity's app); symptom is blank toasts in every non-source locale because the map entry sat in the entity's app.

## v4.3.9 — Compound: review-pending race guard generalized to the engine-adapter contract + Bugbot

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` of the false-CLEAN failure mode that surfaced live in v4.3.7's own review loop (PR #148): a review engine's check-run flips to `completed` *before* its inline review posts, so a poll in that gap reads DONE + zero findings and the loop declares a false CLEAN. v4.3.7 fixed it in the Copilot adapter only; this generalizes the guard.

### Added

- **`skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md`** § Review-state gate — new **review-pending guard** as an engine-general MUST: an adapter must not report DONE off **any** `completed` check-run (**conclusion-agnostic** — an engine like Bugbot that concludes non-success on findings would otherwise slip a findings check-run that completes before its comments post through to a false CLEAN) until a posted review for the head SHA (`LATEST_REVIEW.COMMIT == head SHA`); until then it downgrades `STATUS` to `in_progress` and MAY emit `<ENGINE>_REVIEW_PENDING`. `CONCLUSION=success` gates only `CLEAN_SIGNAL` synthesis and the **settle-valve release** (a review-less check-run is trusted as DONE after the window only when `success`; a non-success review-less run is held → HUNG, never reported clean), never the downgrade itself. A `<ENGINE>_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS` valve (default 600) covers the check-run-only-no-review case; settle math must use Python `datetime` (cross-platform), never `date -d` (GNU-only). Any new engine that synthesizes clean from a check-run inherits the requirement.

### Fixed

- **`tools/find_bugbot_comments.sh`** — applied the review-pending guard (previously only in the Copilot adapter): the check-run→`CLEAN_SIGNAL` synthesis was structurally identical and equally susceptible. Now gated on a posted `cursor[bot]` review for the head SHA + zero **active** inline findings (the synthesis precheck — in both adapters — is **head-aware**: it counts only findings on the head-SHA review (empty when no head review), so neither stale comments GitHub keeps visible after a fix nor the settle-valve check-run-only path are blocked by a prior-SHA review's comments), with `STATUS` downgrade + `BUGBOT_REVIEW_PENDING` marker and a `BUGBOT_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS` valve. Switched the script to `set -eo pipefail` (consistency with the copilot adapter) and added `|| true` to the field-extract pipelines so an in-progress check-run's empty `CONCLUSION=` (which makes the `grep` exit non-zero) doesn't abort under pipefail. `skills/review-loop/references/engine-bugbot.md` documents the caveat in § Clean detection + § Race-condition caveats.

## v4.3.8 — Compound: lazy-load heavy assets on HTMX nav + isolate-to-classify test triage

### Added

- **`skills/django-frontend/references/LAZY_LOAD_HEAVY_ASSETS_ON_HTMX_NAV.md`** (+ SKILL.md pointer) —
  the load-on-nav pattern for heavy per-surface JS bundles in an HTMX app-shell: one server manifest
  feeding both the cold-load `<script>` tags and a nav-time `data-*` attribute ("declare once, render
  twice"; `static()`-resolved at request time because hashed-static can't be hardcoded client-side); a
  loader with its own `htmx:afterSwap` that reads the fresh node, injects sequentially, in-flight-dedupes,
  always re-inits; `ready()` must validate the bundle's LAST global (else a partial load sticks
  half-loaded); injected binders need a `readyState`-safe boot + idempotent container-scoped init (now
  the shared `HTMX_WIDGET_LIFECYCLE` contract); shell-infra scripts stay eager.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_WIDGET_LIFECYCLE.md`** (+ SKILL.md pointer) — new canonical
  reference for the shared HTMX-swapped-widget contract: (re-)init on `htmx:afterSwap` (subscribe on
  `document`, read the FRESH post-`outerHTML` node), idempotent `Map`-tracked mount that doubles as the
  `htmx:beforeSwap` teardown roster, container-scoped `initXIn(root)`, `readyState`-safe boot. Extracted
  because the same lifecycle guidance was duplicated across the always-loaded glue (`VENDORING_JS_BUNDLES`)
  and the lazy-injected binder (`LAZY_LOAD_…`) — skill-discovery could land on either or both and pay
  twice for one payload. Both now point here.

### Changed

- **`skills/django/references/TESTING.md`** — added an "isolate-to-classify" triage subsection: re-run a
  pooled-suite failure under the single-worker/cold-DB runner FIRST to classify it (passes-in-isolation =
  pooling state-bleed → fix the test's isolation; fails-in-isolation = deterministic-real → fix the
  code/test) before spending effort on the wrong layer; adding tests shifts the `loadscope` distribution
  and can surface a latent bleed in a previously-green sibling.
- **`skills/django-frontend/references/VENDORING_JS_BUNDLES.md`** — integration-glue lifecycle items
  (discover / mount / teardown / idempotency) collapsed to a `HTMX_WIDGET_LIFECYCLE` pointer, keeping the
  vendoring-specific deltas (race-safe uploads, form integration); + an app-shell caveat pointing at
  `LAZY_LOAD_…` (eager `extra_js` `<script>` doesn't re-run on shell-nav). `HTMX_WIDGETS.md`'s re-init
  note now points at the lifecycle contract too.

## v4.3.7 — Compound: AST module-split recipe + xdist message level/tag isolation + forced-atomic rename bridge

### Added

- **`skills/django/references/MODULE_SPLIT_AST_EXTRACTION.md`** — byte-exact `ast`-driven recipe for splitting a large flat module into a package: bucket-by-name-prefix, leading-comment + PEP-224 attribute-docstring span capture, lossless-coverage assertion, blank-line-only `autopep8 --select=E301..E306` normalization (not full reformat), `pyflakes` import-trim as the missed-cross-dependency safety net. The recipe is **Python-general** (stdlib `ast` / `autopep8` / `pyflakes`; only the verification step is framework-flavored) and **owns the forced-atomic-member sequencing** (§ *Sequencing — the forced-atomic member*) rather than duplicating it into the rename-before-drop rule. Pointer added to `skills/django/SKILL.md`.

### Changed

- **`skills/django/references/TESTING.md`** — extended the `loadscope` message-framework isolation coverage with the **level + tag vector** the existing storage-lock recipe misses: an inferred-severity assertion can lose a level via ambient `settings.MESSAGE_LEVEL` (level-drop) or a leaked module-global `LEVEL_TAGS` remap (tag-mismap), independent of the storage instance. Fix = `@override_settings(MESSAGE_TAGS={})` (rebuild global tags) + instance `storage.level = messages.DEBUG`; "a severity can vanish only two ways → cover both" elimination logic; eager-`msg`-eval `AttributeError` diagnostic caution.
- **`docs/rules/RULE_rename-before-drop-rationale.md`** — brief **forced-atomic member** pointer: a flat→package split has one rename member that can't keep a drop-later shim (module ≡ package dotted path → the package `__init__` re-export is its transparent bridge), the rest ride normal shims. Full mechanics + mixed-bridge sequencing live in the Python-general module-split reference; the rule points there rather than duplicating it.

### Fixed

- **`tools/find_copilot_comments.sh` + `skills/review-loop/references/engine-copilot.md`** — Copilot **review-pending race guard**. Copilot's `copilot-pull-request-reviewer` check-run flips to `completed`+`success` *before* its inline review posts (3m42s lag observed on this very PR: check-run 13:32:56Z, review with 2 findings 13:36:38Z), so a `/review-loop` poll landing in that gap saw DONE + zero findings and declared a **false CLEAN**, missing both findings. The adapter now trusts a completed check-run as DONE only once Copilot has posted a review for the head SHA; until then it downgrades the emitted `STATUS` to `in_progress` (loop keeps waiting) and emits an informational `COPILOT_REVIEW_PENDING` marker. A `COPILOT_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS` valve (default 600) covers the rare check-run-only-no-review case so the loop doesn't poll to its idle timeout. `CONCLUSION=success` is never a clean verdict (Copilot returns it with or without findings).

(2026-05-27, [#148](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/148))

## v4.3.6 — Compound: shell-rebind re-seed + e2e seed determinism + review-loop cap

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` harvest from an org-management surface-migration sprint (largest admin surface reframed as a per-org dashboard, first real shared-table consumer), three reusable learnings routed into existing skill surfaces — references-first, no new files, no new top-level rules.

### Changed

- `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` — raise `max_active_work_minutes` 180 → 240 (and its two dependent references: the scratch-field `/240` and the Phase-4 hand-back guard). 180 was tripping on large multi-engine surface-migration PRs whose legitimate fix-cycle count accumulates real active-work minutes past the old cap; 240 covers them without weakening the runaway-loop backstop (the `commits_this_session = 20` and `max_idle_polls = 20` guards are unchanged).
- `skills/django-frontend/references/SESSION_FILTER_PERSISTENCE.md` — new § *A shared rebind that REBUILDS a widget must re-seed selection from the server DOM*: when a dependent-control cascade re-renders a selection widget (e.g. a tag picker rebuilt on scope change), the shell-nav/fragment-swap rebind must re-seed `selectedIds` from the server-rendered checked DOM, exactly as the first-load init does. Otherwise re-entry rebuilds to `[]` and silently wipes the checked state while the server session keeps the filter — list stays filtered, boxes read unchecked, and the next click clobbers the persisted filter. Locked with a shell-nav round-trip Playwright assertion on the control's checked state, not just the list (the desync passes a list-only assertion).
- `skills/django-frontend/references/MULTI_TENANT_PLAYWRIGHT.md` — new § *Seed determinism* + a matching anti-pattern bullet: a corpus shape a test needs (especially a parametrized sweep across surfaces/models) must be guaranteed deterministically by the seed, never assumed present in a long-lived dev tenant. A test that finds the shape incidentally passes locally and fails on a fresh-volume/CI/`--reset` tenant. Discipline: amend the seed (idempotent + non-destructive heal), lock the invariant in a fast unit test, make corpus-absence a hard `fail` not a `skip`.

(2026-05-27, [#147](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/147))

## v4.3.5 — Compound: cotton-Bulma prop/positioning traps + single-source filter trigger

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` harvest from a tables / search-input / pagination consolidation sprint (shared `<c-table>` + `<c-search-input>` primitives, all filter forms unified onto one HTMX trigger), four reusable patterns routed into existing skill references plus one new reference — references-first placement, no new top-level rules.

### Added

- `skills/django-frontend/references/FILTER_FORM_TRIGGER_SINGLE_SOURCE.md` — new reference: kill per-surface `hx-trigger` drift by sharing one `FILTER_FORM_HX_TRIGGER` constant via a `{% filter_form_trigger %}` tag across every filter form. Covers the form-level event-filtered trigger (`from:select` / `from:input[type=checkbox]` / `from:input[type=text]` / `from:input[type=search]`), the `type=search`-alongside-`type=text` drift bug (+ its JS `htmxFiresOnText` double-fire mirror), the enumerate-and-grep drift-guard test, and the clear-✕ that clears only `q` and re-submits carrying every other filter (document-delegated, CSS `:placeholder-shown` visibility).

### Changed

- `skills/django-frontend/references/COTTON.md` — three additions. (1) Refines § *Default-true cotton props*: `is not False` is insufficient when a caller passes the unbound string `"false"` (truthy non-empty string); a correctness-bearing boolean prop needs the case-insensitive dual guard `X != False and X|lower != 'false'` (Python's `str(False)`→`"False"` vs JS/JSON→`"false"`), locked with a render-and-assert test that passes the prop as the string. (2) New § on a cotton primitive inside a Bulma layout class (`.control.has-icons-right` etc.): Bulma's descendant selectors force-position any matching child, so a glyph wrapped in `.icon` gets pinned to a `2.5em` box and mis-centres on `is-small` — render the glyph bare and copy Bulma's *working* centring recipe for the case (the native `<select>` arrow's `top:50% + translateY`), not the superficially-similar `has-icons-right .icon` box. (3) New § on a structural element that is itself an `hx-target` (poll-into-`<tbody>`): the primitive's collapse-to-empty-state would remove the poll target from the DOM, so gate the empty-state OUTSIDE the primitive and force `:is_empty="False"` — same primitive, opposite empty-state placement depending on which element the caller targets.
- `skills/django/references/TESTING.md` — adds § *Pooled-suite catalog-cache leakage* under Language and Locale: a `gettext_lazy` message that resolves to `''` is silently dropped by `messages.add_message` (`if not message: return`); a sibling test can leave an empty `en` catalog cached in the process-global `trans_real._translations`, making a message-presence assertion pass solo but fail order-dependently under the pooled/xdist suite. Fix: `trans_real._translations.clear()` in `setUp` to force `en` to rebuild from disk.

(2026-05-26, [#146](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/146))

## v4.3.4 — Compound: reproducible-e2e + tenant-seed patterns

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A `/compound` harvest from a reproducible-e2e-environment sprint (idempotent tenant seed + Playwright gate hardened to run from a fresh docker volume), five reusable patterns routed into existing skill references (one new reference) — references-first placement, no new top-level rules.

### Added

- `skills/django/references/IDEMPOTENT_SEED_COMMANDS.md` — new reference for seed/management commands that must provision from nothing AND top up an existing DB: the idempotency trio (attach M2M/GenericFK unconditionally not only on `created`; correct privileged-user flags on existing rows without touching passwords; handle a globally-unique-field conflict by claim-if-free-else-warn instead of `IntegrityError`-abort, then re-assert invariants like "a primary always exists") + a `DEBUG`-gated production safety guard on the **command** (not the function, so the `DEBUG=False` unit test can still call it).

### Changed

- `skills/django/references/MULTI_TENANT.md` — adds § *Tearing down a real tenant in tests*: a `TransactionTestCase` that creates a real tenant schema can't tear down via `org.delete()` ORM cascade (the collector queries tenant-schema tables — `django_admin_log`, content FKs — from the public connection → `relation does not exist`); drop the schema with `_drop_schema(force_drop=True)` then raw-SQL-delete the public rows.
- `skills/sprint-auto/references/PARALLEL_WORKTREE_DOCKER.md` — adds the `networks: !reset` trap: a per-service network reset nullifies the whole key and the stack falls back to the compose `default` network; a profile-gated service (e.g. e2e `playwright`) the override generator didn't enumerate keeps the parent's pinned `ipv4_address` and breaks ("no configured subnet contains IP" / "could not translate host name db"). Fix: attach the profile service to BOTH the custom network and `default`.
- `skills/django-frontend/references/VISUAL_ACUITY_TESTS_VIA_PLAYWRIGHT.md` — two bootstrap traps: (8) empty `STATIC_ROOT` on a fresh volume → `/static/*.js` 404 → Alpine/HTMX shell never initialises → mass `wait_for_selector` timeouts that look like a harness bug; the e2e entrypoint must `compile_scss` + `collectstatic` (provision assets AND data). (9) the e2e `pytest.ini` `testpaths` must be absolute — a flags-only `ARGS` drops the path and collects the whole repo's unit suite against the live DB, seeding stray rows.
- `skills/review-loop/` — **removed the 5-min retrigger spacing rule entirely** and recast the retrigger/wait logic as an explicit per-engine state machine `NOT_TRIGGERED → TRIGGERED → RUNNING → DONE`, gated on the engine's check-run `STATUS` (`queued`/`in_progress` = RUNNING, `completed` = DONE). The orchestrator retriggers only after a push or from the zero-activity bootstrap and never while a check-run is RUNNING, so the timer it guarded against (same-SHA queue-stacking) is structurally impossible — the state machine subsumes it. **Clean is now structural** — DONE + zero active findings matching `LATEST_REVIEW` — never inferred from check-run `CONCLUSION` (`success` ≠ "no findings") or review-body prose; the legacy `*_CLEAN_SIGNAL` marker is demoted to non-authoritative. Touches SKILL.md (Phase 3 + Phase 4 decision tree + scratch fields) and all four references. Surfaced while dogfooding this loop on its own PR: the spacing timer caused billed Info-nit thrash cycles, and the check-run status (visible in the GitHub UI as "Copilot is reviewing…") proved programmatically queryable as a precise readiness gate.

## v4.3.3 — Compound: 5 review-loop patterns

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A pure `/compound` harvest from a cross-project multi-engine review loop — five reusable patterns routed into existing references (no new files, references-first placement), then curated for DRY against the vault and Copilot-cleared.

### Changed

- `skills/django-frontend/references/PREVIEW_DRAWER_URL_STACK.md` — extends the per-entity hard-gate trap with its at-scale resolution: collapse ≥3 per-entity `entityChanged` listeners to ONE convention-driven generic listener (selectors derived from `payload.type`; new surfaces opt in with nothing to register), loaded GLOBALLY (not per-shell `extra_js`, which dies on cross-surface shell-nav). The document-vs-`document.body` registration rationale points to [`ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md`](skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md) §11 rather than restating it (curation dedup).
- `skills/django/references/I18N_WORKFLOW.md` — the same msgid can be extracted into MULTIPLE app catalogs; translate-fill force-sync resolves per-app, so a msgid must be aligned in EVERY app map + `FORCE_SYNC_MSGIDS`, not just the one you noticed — else catalogs silently disagree across surfaces.
- `skills/review-loop/references/common-review-findings.md` — two catalogue entries: #20 destructive function-based view reachable via GET = CSRF vector (`@require_POST` + GET→405 test); #21 the judgment sibling-sweep (a security/correctness finding on new code usually pre-exists in siblings — fix all same-PR, severity-gated), contrasted with the mechanical contract-sweep (#19).
- `skills/compound/SKILL.md` step 6 + `skills/compound/references/mind-vault-promotion.md` + `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 4b — codify the **compounds-patch-bump policy**: a pure `/compound` PR to mind-vault increments the patch version by 1 (`vX.Y.Z → vX.Y.(Z+1)`) with its own `## v` CHANGELOG section, executed by `/compound` (a compound has no IDEA, so `/wrap` never runs to bump it). Lives in mind-vault rather than auto-memory so overnight/remote (VPS) compounds apply it identically. This v4.3.3 entry is itself the policy's first application.

## v4.3.2 — `/wrap --scope` enum: docs-default, merge opt-in

Patch release on the v4.3 line (IDEA-008). The structural completion of v4.3.1's wrap-before-review pattern: replaces `/wrap`'s `SCOPE_IDEA_ONLY` boolean with a three-value `--scope` enum (`docs` default | `full` | `idea-only`) and **flips the no-arg default from full-wrap (reached Step 8 atomic-merge) to docs-only (structurally cannot reach Step 8)**. Atomic merge is now the explicit `--scope=full` opt-in — so the two-pass `docs → review → full` flow is enforced by the tool, not by an operator remembering to "stop before Step 8" (the v4.3.1 footgun). Architect-reviewed 🟢 SOUND; dogfooded by wrapping this very PR with the new `docs` default. Behavioral change for adopters: a bare `/wrap NNN` no longer auto-merges non-protected targets — run `/wrap --scope=full NNN` for that.

### Changed

- `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` — scope detection rewritten from the `SCOPE_IDEA_ONLY` boolean to a `--scope=docs|full|idea-only` enum with a per-scope step-set table; `docs` is the default. Step 8 (atomic merge) now gates on `scope=full`; Step 5 (teardown) stays mode-gated (post-merge), orthogonal to scope. Steps 3 + 4 gained idempotency guards (the two-pass flow re-runs them routinely, so grep-and-skip prevents duplicate index/devlog entries). Step 4b predicate + description + opening framing updated.
- `skills/wrap/references/ATOMIC_MERGE.md` — Step 8 now requires the `--scope=full` precondition; the "Why this exists" rationale reframed (it previously argued against what is now the safe default).
- `skills/wrap/references/WRAP_BEFORE_REVIEW.md` — the two-pass model is now structural (`docs` pass-1 cannot reach merge; `--scope=full` pass-2 merges); dropped the resolved "tracked as IDEA-008" forward-reference.
- `docs/guides/SPRINT_WORKFLOW.md`, `README.md`, `docs/guides/ONBOARDING.md` — wrap stage description corrected: pre-merge docs-finalization by default, `--scope=full` to also merge (was mislabeled "post-merge" in README/ONBOARDING).

(2026-05-25, [#142](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/142))

## v4.3.1 — Wrap-before-review ordering + two review-surfaced traps

Patch release on the v4.3 line. A doc-heavy compound: codifies running wrap's doc-finalization *before* `/review-loop` for doc-heavy PRs (the reviewer then sees docs at shipped state, so doc-consistency findings land alongside code findings with no post-review drift), plus two traps surfaced by a downstream multi-engine review run, plus a token-optimization prose pass (~20% off the new reference, no semantic change). Dogfooded its own lesson — wrapped before the Copilot review, which then caught the doc-consistency nits the pattern predicts (a "frontmatter-edit only" contradiction, a merge-terminus ambiguity, an Unreleased-formatting divergence), each fixed in-loop.

### Added

- `skills/wrap/references/WRAP_BEFORE_REVIEW.md` — for doc-heavy PRs, run wrap's doc-finalization (frontmatter flip, ideas-index move, devlog, downstream-docs scan) *before* `/review-loop` so the reviewer sees docs at shipped state: doc-consistency findings land in the same pass as code findings, no post-review doc drift. Merge stays post-review-clear (wrap Step 8 unaffected).

### Changed

- `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 2 — mandatory sub-step: the `status` frontmatter flip must also sync the human-readable `**Status**: 🚧 In Progress` body-prose line, else a doc-reviewing engine flags the frontmatter↔body mismatch (a self-inflicted finding the wrap itself creates). Plus a `## References` pointer to the new ordering doc.
- `skills/django-frontend/references/PREVIEW_DRAWER_URL_STACK.md` — new "per-entity hard-gate reuse trap" section: a type-gated `entityChanged` listener (`if payload.type !== 'X' return`) can't be shared across entity surfaces by `<script>` include — the gate silently swallows foreign-type payloads, leaving the drawer open on a just-deleted record. Each surface needs its own `<entity>_actions.js` (or a type-keyed dispatch past ~3 entities); includes the `RULE_self-sweep` grep heuristic.
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md` — CWD/repo-resolution gotcha for `find_*` / `*_retrigger` adapter scripts: `gh` resolves the repo from the current dir, so running shared tools from the wrong dir yields a false "no activity" or `Could not resolve to a PullRequest`. Invoke by absolute path from the project checkout, or cross-check with direct `gh api`.

(2026-05-25, [#141](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/141))

## v4.3 — Review-surface collapse: single `/review-loop` entry

Minor release on the v4 line (IDEA-006). Collapses the review surface to one entry point: deletes the two deprecated thin-wrapper commands (`/bugbot-loop`, `/copilot-loop`, deprecated in v4.2) and the two sub-agent profiles (`AGENT_bugbot`, `AGENT_copilot`) that predated the IDEA-005 shared core — leaving `/review-loop <PR> <engine>` as the sole review entry point. The two **word-for-word identical** Tier-1 catalogues consolidated into one shared `common-review-findings.md` (deduplicated against existing vault homes, not just across engines). `sprint-auto` now dispatches a single multi-engine `/review-loop` call (concurrent sync, N-engine-general) instead of two sequential per-engine loops. Shipped in two PRs per `rename-before-drop`: **#139 prepared** (migrate content + rewire every reference, all files still present), **#140 dropped** (delete the four files). The PR-1 multi-engine review loop itself surfaced two budget-semantics consistency findings (bugbot), both fixed before merge.

### Added

- `skills/review-loop/references/common-review-findings.md` — the codified Tier-1 review-finding catalogue, consolidated ONCE out of the (word-for-word identical) `AGENT_bugbot.md` + `AGENT_copilot.md` copies and deduplicated against existing homes (#15→SHELL_INSTALLERS, #17/#18→ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS, #19→RULE_self-sweep): a scannable index — one-line + link for patterns with a canonical home, full prose only for the homeless. Both engine adapters reference it.

### Changed

- `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` + `references/escalation-policy.md` — review dispatch rewired from two sequential single-engine loops to a **single** `/review-loop <PR> $SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE` call carrying all configured engines (concurrent multi-engine sync when >1, N-engine-general). The per-pass escalation cap (20 deliverables / 5 docs / etc.) is now a single shared budget across engines (was effectively 20-per-engine under sequential loops), kept explicitly distinct from `/review-loop`'s own internal `max_commits_per_session`.
- `engine-bugbot.md` / `engine-copilot.md` / `engine-adapter-contract.md` / `SKILL.md` (review-loop) — § Common patterns now links the shared catalogue; copilot's "Per AGENT_copilot.md" attributions made adapter-owned; obsolete pointers/notes dropped.
- Project-wide reference sweep (README, guides, `compound`/`work`/`dependabot-triage`/`deployment` skills, tool-script comments) — every `AGENT_bugbot`/`AGENT_copilot` + `/bugbot-loop`/`/copilot-loop` pointer retargeted to `/review-loop` / the engine refs.
- `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` § Self-mode — corrected a stale claim (`/compound` rider, surfaced during this IDEA's own wraps): mind-vault **does** dogfood its own sprint workflow (tracks IDEAs in `docs/ideas/` + `docs/archive/`, has `docs/ideas/README.md`), so a mind-vault wrap that maps to a mind-vault IDEA runs Steps 1–3 normally; the only self-mode specialization is Step 4 (CHANGELOG, not DEVELOPMENT_LOG). Dropped the false "no `docs/ideas/README.md`" detection signature.

### Removed

- `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` + `agents/AGENT_copilot.md` — sub-agent profiles superseded by the IDEA-005 shared `review-loop` skill + per-engine adapter references + `common-review-findings.md`. Their unique content (Common Patterns catalogue, failure-mode taxonomy, autonomy ladder) was migrated in #139; the autonomy ladder / hard bounds were already canonical in `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md`.
- `commands/bugbot-loop.md` + `commands/copilot-loop.md` — the deprecated thin wrappers (v4.2 deprecation, removal targeted at v4.3, now done). `/review-loop <PR> bugbot` / `/review-loop <PR> copilot` / `/review-loop <PR> bugbot,copilot` replace them.

## v4.2.2 — Doc-consistency self-sweep (RULE_self-sweep-before-push trigger 5)

Patch release on the v4.2 line. Extends `RULE_self-sweep-before-push` from `.py`/`.js` source to **doc-heavy commits** (substantial IDEA / index / plan / devlog markdown, even alongside code) with a 5th trigger: a pre-flight **doc-consistency sweep**. Doc-heavy PRs draw a predictable review-bot Info-finding class that is entirely locally checkable; bots emit these one nit per billed review cycle, so a session otherwise burns N cycles clearing N cosmetic nits one at a time. The sweep collapses that to zero by running the same logic locally before the first trigger. Six checks: (1) frontmatter `related`/`depends_on`/`supersedes` ↔ body-prose symmetry, every id and edge; (2) every id in an ordering/recap block has an index-table row; (3) count/range claims match the listed set; (4) domain-terminology precision (shared-schema vs per-tenant); (5) PR-description ↔ final-diff drift; (6) frontmatter formatting matches repo convention. The always-on rule body carries a terse numbered stub; the full recipe + grep + per-cycle billing math load on demand from the rationale doc. The PR dogfooded its own check #5 — its description had drifted to "five checks" after the 6th landed; caught and corrected in the wrap. Also bundled: a **release-version-extraction hardening** that surfaced while wrapping this release — `make release` now requires a `MAJOR.MINOR` dot when reading the topmost CHANGELOG header, so a bare `## v5` milestone banner can never shadow the real release header and get tagged as a truncated `v5`.

### Added

- `docs/rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push-rationale.md` § "Doc-Consistency Sweep — Full Recipe" — the six-check recipe with mechanical `comm`/`awk`/`grep` one-liners for checks 2 and 6, the django-tenants shared-vs-per-tenant terminology worked example (check 4), and the per-cycle billing rationale (a bot charges a full billed round-trip per nit, emitted one at a time → cost is multiplicative in latent nits, not additive). (PR #138.)
- `tests/fixtures/release/changelog-bare-milestone/` + two `tests/test_release_extraction.sh` assertions — a bare-`## v5`-banner shadow fixture (must extract `v5.0.0`, not `v5`) and a guard that runs extraction against the **live repo CHANGELOG** and asserts a fully-qualified `vMAJOR.MINOR[.PATCH]`. `make test-release` now enforces the version-header invariant on the real file, not just fixtures. (PR #138.)

### Changed

- `rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md` — trigger count 4 → 5; intro extended from "Python or JS source" to "**or makes substantial doc/markdown changes**"; new trigger-5 stub as a terse numbered (1)–(6) list; When-This-Applies gains a doc-heavy bullet and broadens "code-review bot" → "review bot (code or doc)". (PR #138.)
- Internal-review tighten of the same PR: fixed a "five checks" → "six" count drift in the rationale (the exact check-#3 failure the rule warns of, stale after the 6th check was added), cut a redundant "Why the bot path is expensive" section that restated the intro, and genericized the check-#1 example ids to `A`/`B`. (PR #138.)
- `Makefile` `EXTRACT_VERSION_SH` + `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 4b detection regex — version-header match tightened from `^## [vV][0-9]` to `^## [vV][0-9]+\.[0-9]` (and the Keep-a-Changelog form to `\[[0-9]+\.[0-9]`), kept in lockstep across both. A bare `## v5` milestone banner is now skipped rather than tagged. Documented the invariant in this file's "How this gets maintained" section; refreshed the wrap skill's stale "header is `v4`" hand-back example. (PR #138.)

(2026-05-25, [#138](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/138))

## v4.2.1 — Single-References rule + first enforcement sweep + tool robustness

Patch release on the v4.2 line. Four cohesive shipments under a single narrative theme of "the single `## References` block per skill, codified + enforced + protected". (1) **Skill-writer rule codified**: `skills/skill-writer/SKILL.md` body §"Body structure" item 5 now mandates the single canonical `## References` block per skill — no `Optional extensions` / `Further reading` / front-loaded mirror lists. Every line of `SKILL.md` is loaded into context on every activation, so duplicated lists double the bill for the same information. Names `django`, `django-frontend`, `deployment` as the three historical violators to consolidate opportunistically. (2) **First reference-doc additions enforcing the discipline**: a new `DIAGNOSTIC_INSTRUMENTATION_HYGIENE.md` reference (flag-gated JS `_trace()` arg-eval trap → lazy `_traceFn(label, () => payload)` remedy) and two new TESTING.md gotchas (FallbackStorage sibling-bleed under `loadscope`, plain-dict-vs-session contract in SimpleTestCase fixtures). (3) **Tool robustness fix**: `tools/find_copilot_comments.sh` clean-phrase matching is now case-insensitive at all three sites — robust to future Copilot template capitalization tweaks that would otherwise silently break review-loop's clean-signal detection. Caught by Copilot reviewing its own adapter; fixed inline rather than via a separate IDEA — trivial single-file mechanical fix earns same-PR ship over backlog ceremony. (4) **First enforcement sweep (IDEA-007)**: removed the duplicate `**Optional extensions** (load on demand):` block from all three offenders, merged unique entries + richer descriptions into the canonical `## References` (append-only; preserves git-blame). **-39 lines total** (-12 django, -8 deployment, -19 django-frontend) on every per-activation context load of three of the highest-frequency skills in the vault. Index-level continuation of IDEA-002's body-level debloat lever. Also dropped the same `Optional extensions` terminology from `skills/deployment/README.md`'s tree-diagram comment.

### Added

- `skills/django-frontend/references/DIAGNOSTIC_INSTRUMENTATION_HYGIENE.md` — flag-gated JS diagnostics (`window.PREVIEW_TRACE`, `window.TIPTAP_TRACE`, etc.): the `_trace()` arg-evaluation trap and the lazy `_traceFn(label, () => payload)` remedy. Codifies the eager-payload defect both Cursor Bugbot and GitHub Copilot flag reliably; ships the thunk pattern from the start to save a review cycle. Pattern surfaced in a consuming project's review cycles.
- `skills/django/references/TESTING.md` § Parallel Execution — two new gotchas: (1) **Sibling-test bleed via `FallbackStorage` tier walk under `loadscope`** — 3-layer fix (pop session keys before storage attach, instantiate `SessionStorage` explicitly, class-level `@override_settings(MESSAGE_STORAGE=...)` lock); (2) **Plain `dict` ≠ Django session in `SimpleTestCase` fixtures** — minimal `dict` subclass with `modified` + no-op `save()`, never `SessionBase` (its abstract methods raise `NotImplementedError`).

### Changed

- `skills/skill-writer/SKILL.md` § "Body structure" item 5 — codifies the **single `## References` block per skill** rule. No `Optional extensions` / `Further reading` / front-loaded mirror lists; every line of `SKILL.md` is loaded into context on every activation, so duplicated lists double the bill for the same information. Names `django`, `django-frontend`, `deployment` as the three historical violators to consolidate opportunistically. (PR #134.)
- `skills/django/SKILL.md`, `skills/deployment/SKILL.md`, `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` — **first enforcement sweep**: removed the duplicate `**Optional extensions** (load on demand):` block from all three; merged any unique entries / richer descriptions into the canonical `## References` (append-only; preserves git-blame). **-39 lines total** (-12 django, -8 deployment, -19 django-frontend) on every per-activation context load of three of the highest-frequency skills in the vault. Index-level continuation of IDEA-002's body-level debloat lever. (PR #135 — IDEA-007.)
- `skills/deployment/README.md` — tree-diagram comment for `references/` no longer reads `# Optional extensions (load on demand)`; aligned with the spec-canonical `## References` terminology. (PR #135.)

### Fixed

- `tools/find_copilot_comments.sh` § `_is_clean_body` + the latest-review CLEAN= classifier + the OTHER_REVIEWS pass — clean-phrase matching is now case-insensitive at all three sites. `CLEAN_PHRASES` stays lowercase; review body lower-cases at compare time. Robust to future Copilot template capitalization tweaks (`"Generated no new comments"` vs current lowercase phrasing) that would otherwise silently break clean-signal detection — the very tool review-loop relies on for the all-engines-CLEAN branch. Surfaced by Copilot reviewing its own adapter during PR #134's review-loop. (PR #134, fixed inline rather than via a separate IDEA — trivial single-file mechanical fix earns same-PR ship over backlog ceremony.)

## v4.2 — Open-source LICENSE + rules-trim + canonical /review-loop

Minor release on the v4 line. Three substantive shipments bundled under a single narrative theme of "lower the always-on cost + cement the canonical surface". (1) **Open-source LICENSE shipped** — Apache-2.0 with explicit patent grant + NOTICE/trademark conventions, closing the gap that mind-vault had been published since v4.0.1 without a license file. (2) **Rules trimmed**: `rules/RULE_{git-safety,self-sweep-before-push,rename-before-drop,cross-idea-amendments}.md` reduced to imperative-only bodies (the four sweep triggers / hard rules / anti-patterns / when-this-applies sections), with rationale, recovery prose, worked examples, edge-case adjudication, and full grep recipes extracted into companion files at `docs/rules/<rule>-rationale.md`. Cuts always-loaded token cost on every session (rules are auto-loaded via the `~/.claude/rules` symlink); rationale loads on demand only when adjudicating an edge case. (3) **Canonical `/review-loop` entry cemented**: README sweep replaces six occurrences of `/<engine>-loop` / `/bugbot-loop` / `/copilot-loop` (v4-highlights, mermaid diagram, agent-personas table, sprint-auto row, Automation section, WATCHER_HYGIENE "Loaded by" list) with the unified `/review-loop` form; three deprecation callouts kept verbatim. Bundled with this: the **deprecation announcement for `/bugbot-loop` and `/copilot-loop` (removal targets v4.3)** — wrappers still work; banner at the top of each command file surfaces the deprecation at invocation time. Also bundled: a **real runtime bug fix** that the multi-engine review of this PR surfaced (the rules-trim work introduced `../docs/rules/<rule>-rationale.md` relative links from rule files; only `rules/` was symlinked into host user-config dirs, so the rationale was unreachable at runtime — fixed by adding `docs/rules` to all 4 host setup scripts + an `mkdir -p` to `mv_link_tree`'s parent-dir handling). Plus a **compound learning** routed back into mind-vault: the codification of copilot's stale-context-findings pattern as a hand-back rule in the review-loop's copilot adapter reference. 10 review cycles on PR #133's multi-engine loop produced this release's narrative — the loop itself is what surfaced the runtime bug and the stale-context rule.

### Added

- `LICENSE` (Apache-2.0) — copyright 2026 Kestutis Januskevicius. Explicit patent grant + NOTICE/trademark conventions chosen over MIT for adopter-lawyer comfort on a public skills/agents library.
- `README.md` License footer pointing at the new file.
- `docs/rules/RULE_{git-safety,self-sweep-before-push,rename-before-drop,cross-idea-amendments}-rationale.md` — extracted bodies from the four trimmed rules. Each holds the long-form "why this matters", worked recovery examples, the full grep recipes, edge-case adjudication, and anti-pattern catalogues that previously lived inline in the rule files.
- `scripts/{setup-claude-code,setup-cursor,setup-opencode,setup-vscode-copilot}-symlinks.sh` now symlink `docs/rules/` alongside `rules/` into each host's user-config tree so `../docs/rules/<rule>-rationale.md` relative links resolve at runtime. Antigravity forwards to the VS Code Copilot script and benefits transitively.
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-copilot.md` § *Stale-context findings — when to bail* — codifies a copilot-specific behavioural pattern: Copilot's review prompt window carries prior-review context, so root-cut fixes can be re-flagged on adjacent surfaces. Hand-back rule: when the per-engine no-progress counter for a category hits 3, route the next same-category finding to Tier 3 with note `copilot reasoning from stale review-context, not current file state`. Per-engine — bugbot's prompt appears more current-state focused. Includes the PR #133 field-observed sequence (cycles 4/8/9/10) as a concrete shape-recognition example.
- Deprecation banners at the top of `commands/bugbot-loop.md` and `commands/copilot-loop.md` — surfaces "use `/review-loop <PR> <engine>` directly" at invocation time so users see it the first time they invoke a deprecated wrapper.

### Changed

- `rules/RULE_{git-safety,self-sweep-before-push,rename-before-drop,cross-idea-amendments}.md` — bodies trimmed to imperative-only. Each file now opens with the rule's hard contract (1–2 paragraphs), the always-applicable triggers / anti-patterns / when-this-applies sections, and a load-on-demand pointer to its `docs/rules/<rule>-rationale.md` companion. Rationale prose, worked recovery examples, edge-case adjudication, and full grep recipes moved out. Net result: less prose loaded on every session, same imperative core, deeper reasoning a single Read-tool-call away.
- `scripts/_symlink-lib.sh` — `mv_link_tree` now `mkdir -p` the target's parent directory so nested targets like `~/.claude/docs/rules` work without the caller having to pre-create intermediate directories.
- `README.md` — v4 highlights, design note on the review stage, agent-personas table, Automation row, Review + PR flow, mermaid diagram, ONBOARDING preview cycle, and WATCHER_HYGIENE "Loaded by" list rewritten to use `/review-loop` as the canonical entry. Three intentional deprecation callouts retained verbatim.

### Deprecated

- **`/bugbot-loop` and `/copilot-loop`** thin-wrapper commands. Canonical entry is `/review-loop <PR> bugbot` / `/review-loop <PR> copilot` / `/review-loop <PR> bugbot,copilot`. Wrappers still work in the interim. **Removal targets v4.3 (upcoming).**

### Removed

- `Companion to [...](../../rules/...)` backlinks from all 4 `docs/rules/*-rationale.md` files. The forward link (rule → rationale) via the host `docs/rules` symlink resolves on all hosts; the reverse link broke under VS Code Copilot's flat `instructions/<name>.instructions.md` layout where there's no `rules/` directory under the symlink root. Cleanest cut: drop the line — the reader of a rationale doc reached it via the forward link, so they already know which rule they're on. No host-coupling, no maintenance burden.

### Fixed

- **Real runtime bug**: `docs/rules/<rule>-rationale.md` relative links from rule files were broken in the symlinked-rules layout (only `rules/` was symlinked; `docs/` was never linked). Surfaced by Copilot review on cycle 4 of this PR's multi-engine loop. Fix lands in the 4 setup scripts (claude-code, cursor, opencode, vscode-copilot+antigravity) plus the `_symlink-lib.sh` parent-mkdir change. Without the catch, the rules-trim work would have shipped with unreachable rationale.
- `docs/rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push-rationale.md` — `grep -rn` examples were missing a path operand (`.`); without it GNU grep reads stdin and appears to hang. Added trailing `.` to both example lines and a clarifying note (with `rg` fallback).
- `LICENSE` leading blank line stripped — Apache's upstream `LICENSE-2.0.txt` ships with one, which can confuse SPDX detectors (GitHub's Licensee and others look for the license header on line 1).
- `README.md` line 68 sprint-auto row — bare prose "the review-loop" promoted to `/review-loop` code-span for internal consistency with the rest of the sentence's command formatting.

(2026-05-21, [#133](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/133))

## v4.1 — Multi-engine review-loop shared core

Minor release on the v4 line. IDEA-005 extracts the duplicated Phase 0/1/2/3/4 orchestrator from `commands/bugbot-loop.md` (~263L) + `commands/copilot-loop.md` (~258L) into a single engine-agnostic `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` (~193L) driven by per-engine adapter references. **Multi-engine concurrent execution is now a first-class supported mode**: the new `commands/review-loop.md` accepts an `ENGINES` list (`bugbot,copilot` or any subset), the multi-engine synchronisation rule lives in one canonical `references/multi-engine-sync.md` instead of being mirrored across both command files, and the adapter contract in `references/engine-adapter-contract.md` generalises cleanly to N engines (one new reference + two shell scripts to add a third engine). The two existing single-engine commands cut to ~15L thin wrappers that delegate to the shared skill. Sprint-auto's existing `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE` selector (`bugbot` / `copilot` / `both` / `none`) now has a matching implementation surface — the public API and the skill structure are aligned for the first time. Cross-project IDEA numbering guard added to `skills/idea/SKILL.md` (the bundled PR #130 rename motivated documenting that each project's numbering is independent: never carry a number from another project's stream — the branch name often references the originating project's IDEA, NOT the target's next number).

### Added

- `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` (193L) — engine-agnostic Phase 0/1/2/3/4 orchestrator with per-engine retrigger spacing, pending-retrigger flush rules, asymmetric-clearance hand-back semantics, anchor-based tool-output parsing, and an explicit guard against the dogfood meta-risk (review-loop's own docs contain literal `"found no new issues"` strings, so the body-text matcher can false-positive on diff content quoted into review bodies).
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md` (140L) — closed contract for adding new engines: tool-surface contract (`tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh` + `tools/<engine>_retrigger.sh`) + reference-surface section template (Identity, Tool invocations, Clean-signal parsing, Staleness rule, Race caveats, Failure modes, Common patterns, Spacing rule).
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-bugbot.md` (~60L) — Cursor Bugbot adapter (at v4.1 deferred Common Bugbot Patterns to `AGENT_bugbot.md` §1-8 — that catalogue was consolidated into `common-review-findings.md` and the agent file removed in v4.3; documents bugbot-specific stall thresholds + line-number drift behaviour).
- `skills/review-loop/references/engine-copilot.md` (~70L) — GitHub Copilot adapter (dual `user.login` identity confirmed empirically: `Copilot` on `/requested_reviewers` + `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` on `/reviews`; retrigger via bare `--add-reviewer @copilot` per the self-removal semantics then documented in `AGENT_copilot.md` — folded into the engine adapters + `common-review-findings.md` and the agent file removed in v4.3; service-error failure mode pattern: 2× consecutive errors stop retrigger this cycle, 3× hand back; check-run synthesis false-positive caveat documented).
- `skills/review-loop/references/multi-engine-sync.md` (~80L) — multi-engine synchronisation contract: wait-for-slowest with trade-off escape hatches (engine stalled per per-engine threshold, Copilot service-error consecutive counts), per-engine scratch-file schema, deterministic alphabetical engine iteration, asymmetric-clearance hand-back templates. Generalises to N engines without modification.
- `commands/review-loop.md` (~60L) — direct multi-engine entry point; canonical home for multi-engine sync mode. `/review-loop <PR> bugbot,copilot` is the natural form when both engines are configured.
- `skills/idea/SKILL.md` § 4 — cross-project IDEA numbering guard: scan ONLY the target project's `docs/ideas/` + `docs/archive/`; never carry a number from another project's stream. The branch name (`compound/...-idea-NNN-...`) references the originating project's IDEA, not the target's next number.

### Changed

- `commands/bugbot-loop.md` (263L → ~15L) — thin wrapper that delegates to the shared review-loop skill with `ENGINES=bugbot`. Engine-specific quirks (clean-signal parsing, race caveats, failure modes, Tier 1 catalogue) moved to `references/engine-bugbot.md`.
- `commands/copilot-loop.md` (258L → ~15L) — same treatment with `ENGINES=copilot`. Copilot-specific quirks (dual `user.login`, service-error pattern, first-run calibration) moved to `references/engine-copilot.md`.
- `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` + `agents/AGENT_copilot.md` — counter-persistence + zero-activity-trigger sections updated for the shared-core scratch path (`review-loop-pr-<N>.md`) and per-engine signal-id field naming (`last_seen_<engine>_signal_id`, formerly `last_seen_comment_id`); explicit HARD SHORT-CIRCUIT directive on trigger-only cycles + engine-namespaced `no_progress_map`. Spinoff IDEA-006 will minify these further.

### Fixed

- `CHANGELOG.md` v4.0.4 citation was `[#127]` but the actual merge PR was `[#128]` (PR #127 — bringing `statusline.sh` into mind-vault — is still open). Corrected inline.

(2026-05-20, [#131](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/131); IDEA-167→IDEA-005 rename absorbed from [#130](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/130))

## v4.0.4 — ONBOARDING expansion + `docs/guides/` subdirectory

Patch release on the v4 line. Two coupled changes: the 30-minute ONBOARDING got the new sections requested for IDEA-004 (inline AI-concepts table, Claude-Code-commands toolbox, context-vs-usage clarifier, TOC, deep-dives index) plus four new deep-dive companions ([GIT_WORKFLOW](docs/guides/GIT_WORKFLOW.md), [WORKTREE_PRACTICES](docs/guides/WORKTREE_PRACTICES.md), [SKILL_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH](docs/guides/SKILL_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH.md), [MEMORY_MANAGEMENT](docs/guides/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md)); and all top-level guide files moved into `docs/guides/` so the `docs/` root stays a clean index. The structural payoff is room to grow more guides without `docs/` ballooning. No skills / agents / commands / rules changed in behaviour — `docs/README.md` and the 16 cross-referencing files updated to the new paths.

### Added

- `docs/guides/GIT_WORKFLOW.md` — branch-per-IDEA discipline, multi-engine review (Bugbot + Copilot), integration-branch pattern for multi-IDEA cohorts, force-push hygiene with `--force-with-lease`, forward-sync direction rule, post-merge cleanup, troubleshooting matrix.
- `docs/guides/WORKTREE_PRACTICES.md` — when to use `git worktree`, port-offset discipline for parallel docker stacks (the +10000/+20000/+30000 convention), the codified `.env` isolation exception for worktree bootstrap, sprint-auto's integration-worktree pattern, teardown discipline.
- `docs/guides/SKILL_AUTHORING_WALKTHROUGH.md` — process companion to [SKILL_SPECIFICATION.md](docs/guides/SKILL_SPECIFICATION.md): decision tree for skill vs rule vs command vs agent, the 500-line body budget and progressive-disclosure rationale, what skills should NOT have (project paths, history trailers, defensive language), the `/compound` lesson-to-skill route, author's pre-merge checklist.
- `docs/guides/MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.md` — four-layer persistence model (auto-memory / `CLAUDE.md` / skills+rules / project docs), right-use-case per layer, rot detection signals + pruning cadence, verify-before-acting discipline, skill-vs-memory disambiguation.
- `docs/guides/ONBOARDING.md` § 2 — "AI concepts — rules vs skills vs agents vs commands" — four-row comparison table + mental shortcuts for which artefact answers which question.
- `docs/guides/ONBOARDING.md` § 5 — "Useful Claude Code commands" — eight-row reference for `/context`, `/usage`, `/effort`, `/compact`, `/new`, `/resume`, `/init`, `/help` with the `/compact`-vs-`/new` trap explicitly called out + a "context window vs subscription limits" callout disambiguating the two budgets.
- `docs/guides/ONBOARDING.md` § 7 — Deep-dives index pointing at the four new companion docs.

### Changed

- `docs/{ONBOARDING,CURSOR_SETUP,SPRINT_WORKFLOW,SKILL_SPECIFICATION}.md` → `docs/guides/`. Existing files relocated; `docs/README.md` rewritten as a tight directory index of the new structure. The four new docs above land directly under `docs/guides/`.
- All cross-references rewritten: 16 files (skills, rules, root README, archived plans, IDEA-004) had their `docs/<FILE>.md` paths updated to `docs/guides/<FILE>.md`. Internal cross-references inside the moved guides rewritten from `../X` to `../../X` for paths to the repo root.

(2026-05-20, [#128](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/128))

## v4.0.3 — Post-wrap release-tagging helper (`make release`)

Patch release on the v4 line. Adds a repo-root `Makefile` with a `release` target that collapses the three-command post-merge sequence (`git tag -a -m "Release <ver>" -- <ver> && git push origin -- <ver> && gh release create --generate-notes -- <ver>`) into one human-invoked command. Version-extraction covers the six sources `/wrap` Step 4b detects; explicit `VERSION=v<N>` overrides auto-detect for projects whose CHANGELOG header version differs from the intended tag (e.g., a single `## v<N>` major-release header covering multiple `v<N>.0.X` patch tags). `/wrap` Step 4b's "Mechanics when a bump is warranted" now surfaces the convention as a post-merge hand-back instruction. No changes to skills / agents / commands / rules beyond the wrap-skill hand-back nudge; the deliverable is the adopter-facing `Makefile` convention.

### Added

- `Makefile` (repo root) — four targets: `release` (extract version, idempotency-check via `git rev-parse --verify --quiet refs/tags/$ver`, `git tag -a` + `git push origin <tag>` + `gh release create --generate-notes`), `extract-version` (prints the version `release` would tag), `test-release` (runs the harness), `help`. Single-file Makefile; bash + `jq` (only for `package.json`). Version-extraction handles all six `/wrap` Step 4b sources in priority order (`VERSION` → `pyproject.toml` → `package.json` → `Cargo.toml` → `setup.py` → `CHANGELOG.md` with `## v<N>` or `## [<N>]` headers). Explicit `VERSION=v<N>` arg overrides auto-detect.
- `tests/test_release_extraction.sh` + `tests/fixtures/release/*` — bash assertion harness invoking `make extract-version` from each fixture dir. Ten cases: seven version-source extractions across six fixture files (`VERSION-only`, `pyproject`, `package`, `cargo`, `setup-py`, `changelog-v`, `changelog-kac`), two `VERSION=` override paths (with and without a source file present), one no-source-no-override error case. All green on first run.

### Changed

- `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 4b § "Mechanics when a bump is warranted" — new sub-bullet 6 ("Surface the post-merge hand-back instruction") routes the wrap summary at *"After merging, run `make release` (or `make release VERSION=v<N>` if the auto-extracted version differs from the intended tag)"* when the project ships a Makefile; manual three-command fallback mentioned for projects without one. Confirms `make release` idempotency so re-running on an existing tag is a clear no-op, not a failure.

(2026-05-19, [#124](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/124))

## v4.0.2 — Windows-host adopter bootstrap

Patch release on the v4 line. Adds the `scripts/install-wsl.ps1` PowerShell installer so fresh Windows 10/11 hosts can bootstrap WSL2 before running any of mind-vault's POSIX setup scripts. No changes to the agent-facing surface (skills / agents / commands / rules untouched); this is purely an adopter-onboarding widening that opens a Windows-host path to the v4 OSS release.

### Added

- `scripts/install-wsl.ps1` — elevated PowerShell installer for fresh Windows 10/11 hosts who need WSL2 before they can use mind-vault. Detects build (Win10 19044+ vs Win10 19041–19043 vs Win11), SLAT + firmware virtualization, ProductType=1 client SKU; enables `Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux` + `VirtualMachinePlatform` with `Get-FeatureState`-based pending-state handling and an `Invoke-RebootGate` helper that fires at every transition point ($rebootNeeded after feature-enable AND after msiexec 3010/1641); modern `wsl --install` on 21H2+ falls back to manual WSL2 kernel MSI on 19041–19043 (downloaded via `New-TemporaryFile`-allocated unique temp path with Authenticode signature verification, absolute Sysnative-aware msiexec.exe path); locale-agnostic distro parser (both-columns-uppercase header detection); `-Force` short-circuits the Read-Host picker for true CI/unattended use; `Invoke-Wsl` wrapper (deliberately no `[CmdletBinding()]` so `-d` flag isn't consumed by `-Debug` common-parameter prefix-matching). Took 17 review cycles in the multi-engine loop (`/bugbot-loop` + `/copilot-loop`) — bugbot caught the 7 substantive PS-specific edge cases (`-d`/`-Debug` swallowing, `2>&1` + ErrorActionPreference=Stop bug, `Restart-Computer -Force` warning surface, `aka.ms/wsl2kernel` returning HTML not MSI, feature-loop pending-reboot break, msiexec 1641 missing $rebootNeeded, all-caps distro-name false-drop), copilot drove defensive polish (Authenticode verify, $LASTEXITCODE checks, EnabledPending/DisabledPending state handling, ARM64 arch detection, Server SKU gate, MSI cleanup in finally, predictable temp-path symlink risk). Surfaced the **multi-engine sync-cycle discipline** as a `/compound` candidate ([memory note](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/blob/main/.claude/memory/projects/mind-vault/) cached locally) — wait for BOTH engines on the same SHA before fixing, batch findings into one commit, avoid stale-SHA chases on the slow engine. Cross-engine validation event in the middle of the loop where bugbot's MEDIUM matched a copilot-suppressed-low-confidence finding (cycle 11's `Invoke-RebootGate` extraction). Pre-merge verification deferred to the user's Windows VM. (2026-05-18, [#120](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/120))

## v4.0.1 — Multi-engine code review + open-source release

Headline: Stage 4 (review) is no longer locked to Cursor Bugbot. Projects opt into Cursor Bugbot (`/bugbot-loop`), GitHub Copilot (`/copilot-loop`), both engines concurrently, or curator-only (no external bot). Sprint-auto resolves the choice from `review_engine:` in `.mind-vault.yml` or `CLAUDE.md` and dispatches per-engine; default is `none`. The codebase narrative is now engine-agnostic — `/bugbot-loop` and `/copilot-loop` are the two engine-specific surfaces, everything else refers to "the review loop" / `/<engine>-loop`.

### Added

- **`commands/copilot-loop.md`** — GitHub Copilot fork of `/bugbot-loop`. Same phase structure, dual-signal enumeration, staleness rules, and hard bounds; engine-specific trigger (`gh pr edit --add-reviewer @copilot`), bot user.login (`copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]`), and clean-signal markers (`COPILOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL`, `COPILOT_LATEST_REVIEW`). Calibration banner at the top flags three first-run constants needing empirical confirmation.
- **`agents/AGENT_copilot.md`** — Copilot reviewer persona. Engine-agnostic 19-pattern review catalogue inherited from `AGENT_bugbot`; trigger/clean-signal sections rewritten for Copilot.
- **`tools/find_copilot_comments.sh`, `tools/copilot_retrigger.sh`** — Copilot-side helper scripts. Bot login + check-run app-slug filter substituted for Copilot's conventions; remove-then-add retrigger fallback documented in script body.
- **`docs/guides/ONBOARDING.md`** — 30-minute onboarding pager for third-party adopters. Walks through mind-vault building blocks, workspace setup, project setup (including engine-picker section), and a five-stage workflow tour. References the engine selector in Stage 4.
- **Review-engine selector in `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md`** — new preflight step 7.5 resolves `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE` from `--review-engine=<value>` arg / `.mind-vault.yml` / `CLAUDE.md`. Accepts `bugbot` / `copilot` / `bugbot,copilot` (or YAML list `[bugbot, copilot]`) / `none` (default). Multi-engine mode dispatches both loops sequentially per pass; each engine gets its own escalation budget.

### Changed

- **`skills/compound/references/review-finding-ingest.md`** (renamed from `bugbot-finding-ingest.md`) — engine-agnostic parsing rules. Same shape applies to `/bugbot-loop` and `/copilot-loop` output; provenance citation now includes engine tag (`bugbot` or `copilot`).
- **`skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` + references + assets** — narrative generalized: "review-loop" replaces "bugbot-loop" where the abstraction is meant; `/<engine>-loop` placeholder for concrete invocations. Scratch-file keys renamed (`deliverables_review_outcome`, `docs_review_outcome`, `re_review_outcome`). Auto-run-log template updated to match.
- **`skills/wrap/SKILL.md` + references** — generalized to engine-agnostic language. ATOMIC_MERGE references both `tools/bugbot_retrigger.sh` and `tools/copilot_retrigger.sh` per the configured engine.
- **`skills/compound/SKILL.md`** — frontmatter and body generalized: consumes review-loop output from either engine.
- **`rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md`, `skills/work/SKILL.md`, `skills/plan/references/*`** — narrative generalized.
- **`README.md`** — command count 16→15 (Cursor 2.x legacy commands retired); "Review + PR flow" line lists `/bugbot-loop` (Cursor Bugbot) and `/copilot-loop` (GitHub Copilot) as engine alternatives; engine-picker note points at onboarding.
- **`skills/dependabot-triage/SKILL.md`** — broken `skills/bugbot/SKILL.md` link replaced with the two engine-specific commands.

### Removed

- **`commands/bugbot.md`, `tools/bugbot.sh`** — Cursor 2.x legacy slash command + monolithic script. Superseded by `/create-pr` + `/bugbot-loop` decomposition; engine-locked to Cursor (`CURSOR_AI_MODE=1`); not invoked by any skill.
- **`commands/bugbot_comments.md`** — thinner re-implementation of `tools/find_bugbot_comments.sh`; engine-locked; only referenced from the README's command list.

### Pre-v4 work folded in (merged into the v4 release)

Pre-v4 sprint output now part of the v4 baseline — every PR listed below is merged. Kept for provenance.

- **Added** five entries promoting a consuming project's learnings to mind-vault, all scrubbed of project-specific anchors per `feedback_skill_changelog_not_inline` + PR #106's always-on-tier criterion. (1) `skills/django-frontend/references/ROUTER_ACTION_VOCABULARY.md` — routers / dispatchers / state-machines emit `{action: '<verb>', …}` with atomic decision verbs only; never compound procedures; two-of-three-callers structural test for vocabulary entry. **Routed as load-on-demand reference rather than a top-level rule** (initial draft was `rules/RULE_no-procedures-in-action-vocab.md`, retired before merge) — the pattern fires only when a JS state-machine / dispatcher is being designed, which is exactly when `Skill django-frontend` is loaded. (2) `skills/django-frontend/references/CSS_DISPLAY_CONTENTS_SELECTOR_TRAPS.md` — CSS selectors see DOM hierarchy, not box-tree transparency; widen every breakpoint's selectors symmetrically when inserting a `display: contents` intermediate; the asymmetric-fix anti-pattern (one breakpoint widened, another missed) is the actual bug surface. (3) `skills/django-frontend/references/DATA_ATTR_NAV_CONVENTION.md` — `<a data-shell-nav-link>` + single document-level JS click handler instead of raw `hx-*` on the link; URL update is a deliberate `history.pushState` step, not a swap side-effect; composable per-breakpoint behaviour; disjoint vocabulary across marker families enforceable in tests. (4) `skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md` extended with gotcha 10 — Alpine `:class="cond && 'str'"` short-circuit syntax ADDS but cannot REMOVE classes; SSR-applied classes survive every reactive flip-to-false; object syntax `:class="{ 'foo': cond }"` is the bidirectional form. (5) `rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md` extended with two new sibling disciplines — Defensive-Code Sweep (verify defensive field reads against the producer's WRITE site; phantom-field guards always fire and mask the actual underlying bug) and Touched-Suite Sweep (fix pre-existing failures in suites you run, even when unrelated to your change; the noise-floor-growth path is the anti-pattern). SKILL.md pointers added in both the in-body and bottom References lists. Originating-project anchors intentionally NOT in any reference / rule body — those tokens are confusion-guarantees for any future project that isn't the originator. Anchors preserved here for incident provenance: a consuming project's click-handler routing extraction (preview_surface.js) surfaced the action-vocabulary rule via architect F1+F2 review; a later IDEA in that project introduced `<div id="shell-swap-target">` with `display: contents` for shell-level HTMX `outerHTML` swaps and the desktop pane-snap SCSS got widened but the mobile @media block was missed — symptom appeared as drawer "wedged" state, masked for an entire PR cycle by a `_enforceDrawerStateForDepth` JS band-aid that read `coord.byName.preview` (phantom field — the real key was `currentByEdge.preview`), forcing `window.location.reload()` on every popstate-with-frames; a follow-up IDEA attributed the actual root cause (mobile SCSS selector miss) and retired the band-aid, also fixing 4 pre-existing `test_preview_surface_openwith.py` failures that had been red on the sprint branch since the click-handler routing refactor extracted `_routeIntent` + `_dispatchIntent` from inline click-handler logic; the same shell-swap IDEA's K-D-12 surfaced the data-attr-nav convention as the cleaner shape than raw `hx-*` on `<a>` after the URL-vs-swap-success coupling and the polymorphism trap surfaced during shell-nav prototyping; the `:class` short-circuit gotcha (gotcha 10) hit during the same shell-nav active-state work — directional asymmetry visible only on hot-swap AWAY from the cold-load active surface. (2026-05-16, [#116](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/116))

- **Added** `skills/work/references/AUDIT_NEWLY_REACHABLE_CODE.md` + pointers from `skills/work/SKILL.md` References, `commands/bugbot-loop.md` Phase 2 (new sub-step between "Apply the edit" and "Run targeted test"), `agents/AGENT_curator.md` PASS 3 (alongside the existing asymmetric-fix sweep bullet), and `agents/AGENT_test-engineer.md` PASS 1 (Boundary Contradiction Sweep). Discipline: when a fix REMOVES a short-circuit (empty-state guard inserted, early-return deleted, missing `init()`/`open()`/`register()` call inserted, async resolution fixed, type-gate relaxed), audit the now-reachable downstream code for latent bugs BEFORE merging — latent bugs masked by the prior short-circuit go from "invisible" to "visibly wrong" the moment the fix lands; user perceives the latent as a regression, blame attaches to the fix. Audit-at-fix-time is the only cheap moment to catch the second half. **Routed as a load-on-demand reference under `skills/work/` rather than a top-level `rules/` rule** per the always-on-tier criterion (`feedback_compound_prefer_references` + PR #106 split): the primary fire sites (`/work`, `/bugbot-loop` Phase 2, `AGENT_curator` PASS 3, `AGENT_test-engineer` PASS 1) all load their owning skill / agent body when active, so the audit guidance loads when needed without paying always-on context cost. Originating-project anchors (a consuming project's PR, fix commit `facd6c08`) intentionally NOT in the reference body — those tokens are confusion-guarantees for any future project that isn't the originator (same scrub principle as `d25ee12`'s RULE_rename-before-drop debloat earlier in this Unreleased section). Anchor preserved here for incident provenance: a consuming project's PR — the `openWith()` empty-stack `open()` fix landed in `d9350e9` (mind-vault PR #114) unmasked a latent gap where `_parseStackPrefix` had always parsed prefix frames as `{type, identifier}` with no title pairing; the drawer chrome rendered with an empty back-affordance + blank title slot the moment the open() fix made the path reachable. User smoke caught it; follow-on commit `facd6c08` extended `_parseStackPrefix(str, titlesJson)` + emitted a parallel JSON-titles tag server-side. The whole second cycle was avoidable with one audit pass at the time of writing the `open()` fix. (2026-05-15, [#115](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/115))

- **Changed** `rules/RULE_rename-before-drop.md` debloat — two verbose Worked Example sections compressed into one inline lesson under *Why This Matters* (the canonical-miss shape: module-level `*_FIELDS` / `_COPY_*` constant in a file the surface-coverage matrix didn't enumerate) plus a new *Two-PR Variant* section that abstracts the convention-migration shape without project-specific anchors. Body shrank 94 → 67 lines (-29%). Cross-project leak removed: rule body no longer cites consumer-project PR numbers, IDEA-NNN identifiers, or project-specific symbol / file paths — those tokens are confusion-guarantees for any project that isn't the originating one, and the always-loaded rule body is the worst place to pay for them. Pattern matches `feedback_skill_changelog_not_inline` + PR #106's always-on-tier criterion (rules carry the invariant; references / consumer-project history carry the anchors). (2026-05-14, \[unmerged\])

- **Changed** `skills/compound/SKILL.md` Step 3 destination table + new sub-section *Mind-vault placement — references / assets first, body last* (~30L), and `skills/compound/references/routing-decision-tree.md` new disambiguation heuristic *Body vs. reference vs. asset (within mind-vault)* + two new anti-pattern bullets. Codifies the load-on-demand-default routing rule for compound's mind-vault promotions: when destination is skill or rule, default to `skills/<owner>/references/<TOPIC>.md` (prose) or `skills/<owner>/assets/<filename>` (templates / scripts / scaffolds); add to SKILL.md body only when the addition is the first concept of a brand-new skill on a new domain OR a ≤5L stub-with-pointer; add a new top-level `rules/RULE_<name>.md` only when the guardrail fires across multiple skills / stages / stack types per PR #106's always-on-tier criterion. The reflex is "would this fire when zero skills are loaded, OR only when this specific skill activates?" — the second case is reference-shaped, which is most learnings. Why: PR #106 (rules-reorg, −983L unconditional load) and IDEA-002 (skill debloat across wrap + django-frontend + django, −748L combined) paid to remove body / always-on bloat. Without an explicit routing rule in `/compound`, future invocations would re-introduce that bloat on first promotion. The rule prevents the cycle. New anti-pattern bullets in routing-decision-tree.md surface "inlining mechanics into SKILL.md body" and "adding a new top-level rule when the guardrail is domain-specific" alongside the existing over-promote / under-promote / misclassify entries. (2026-05-09, [#112](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/112))

## 2026-05

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/references/VISUAL_ACUITY_TESTS_VIA_PLAYWRIGHT.md` — when to write Playwright vs render-and-assert (decision table: sequence-of-actions / client-reactivity + server-swaps / viewport-dependent / URL-state-assertion → Playwright; else render-and-assert), the "every client-reactive + server-swapping element needs an end-to-end case" methodology rule, the first-suite cost-benefit threshold (bootstrap only at ≥3 documented integration-shape regression classes), and the Docker+Django e2e bootstrap traps not in `MULTI_TENANT_PLAYWRIGHT.md` (separate `requirements-e2e.txt`; MS-image vs project Python-version gap → pin the playwright lib + avoid PEP 695 in shared e2e code; `audioop-lts` 3.13+-wheel trap on 3.12 images; Chromium refuses CDP Host-header override → use ALLOWED_HOSTS + non-primary Domain routing; the three live-DB Django opt-outs; never volume-mount a file under a directory mount; language-cookie injection for stable string assertions). **Changed** `/compound` scrub/provenance rules (`skills/compound/SKILL.md` + references) — foreign-project PR/IDEA refs stay in the commit message, never the mind-vault file body. **Removed** trailing `**Last Updated**` footers across the skill/reference tree per the route-incident-detail-to-CHANGELOG convention. (2026-05-22, [#137](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/137))

- **Added** `scripts/statusline-command.sh` — the maintainer's six-segment Claude Code status line (📌 topic / ctx:N% / ⬆in ⬇out \[↺cache\] turn-token meter / 7d rate-limit % / 🧠 effort / vim mode; `│`-separated, color-tiered) + a three-branch symlink installer in `scripts/setup-claude-code-symlinks.sh` (refresh existing symlink / skip+preserve a non-symlink local file / fresh symlink) + a README "Claude Code extra config" snippet. Supersedes the alternative proposed in #127 — ships the version actually running locally, named to match existing `settings.json` paths for zero-friction adoption. (2026-05-22, [#136](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/136))

- **Changed** self-mode `/wrap` paper trail for IDEA-005 (post-merge fallback after #131): archived the IDEA to `docs/archive/2026-05-idea-005-review-loop-shared-core/` with `status: complete`, re-sorted `docs/ideas/README.md`, opened the `## v4.1` CHANGELOG section, and patched Step-6 doc drift (`GIT_WORKFLOW.md` / `WORKTREE_PRACTICES.md` dead `skills/{bugbot,copilot}-loop/` links → `skills/review-loop/`; `/review-loop` added to README + ONBOARDING). **Changed** IDEA-006 capture — sharpened direction from "thin the agent files" to "delete `AGENT_bugbot.md` + `AGENT_copilot.md` outright" (curator + shared review-loop skill + engine references already cover their surface), via a bisectable three-PR migrate→cross-ref→delete sequence. (2026-05-20, [#132](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/132))

- **Changed** six reference-tier compound destinations from a downstream multi-engine review loop (load-more contract + `<c-list-wrapper>` cotton primitive): `skills/django-frontend/references/COTTON.md` gains slot-truthiness (caller-decides-visibility), empty-state-inside-slot (atomic-swap filter forms), and pager + empty-state mutex (page-beyond-end edge); `HTMX_PATTERNS.md` gains the cotton outer-id + `innerHTML` collision rule (a partial with its own outer wrapper must swap `outerHTML`); `skills/plan/references/architect-handoff.md` gains the separate-STRUCTURAL-INTENT-from-CONSEQUENT-MECHANIC discipline (ground-truth an architect amendment's mechanics at /work time); `skills/wrap/references/EVAL_GATE_EMISSION.md` gains the three-signal-class comparison (render-and-assert / bot / manual overlap less than they look). **Changed** both `commands/bugbot-loop.md` + `commands/copilot-loop.md` — retrigger spacing ≥5 min, one per cycle (same queueing behaviour, different mechanism per engine). All load-on-demand; no new top-level rule, no SKILL.md body growth. (2026-05-20, [#129](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/129))

- **Added** `docs/ideas/IDEA-004-onboarding-dev-env-walkthrough.md` — IDEA capture for the ONBOARDING expansion (eight section topics + dev-env hygiene best-practices). Backlog item that shipped as v4.0.4 (see above). (2026-05-19, [#125](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/125))

- **Changed** `README.md` — prominent ONBOARDING redirect block hoisted above the inventory tables so first-time readers land on the 30-minute tour before scanning the full skill/agent/rule catalogue. Tiny structural nudge, motivated by v4 going OSS-release. (2026-05-19, [#126](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/126))

- **Added** five compound learnings from a downstream-project multi-engine review loop (cotton-DRY refactor PR, 5-cycle bugbot + 3-cycle copilot). Two new sections in `skills/django-frontend/references/COTTON.md`: (1) **Dict-literal cotton props silently drop context vars** — `django-cotton ≥ 2.6` does NOT evaluate template context variables inside dict-literal cotton-attr values; `:link_attrs="{'k': ctx_var}"` becomes `{}` at render time and conditional gates inside the cotton emit nothing, with no JS or template-render error. Workaround is two single-value props (`:prop1="ctx_var"`); when a dict shape is genuinely needed, build it in the view and reference as a single context-var name. Includes reproducer + regression-test pattern locked on context-var resolution (not literal). (2) **Slot-based composition vs prop-driven enumeration for multi-action cottons** — default to slot-based for cluster wrappers (caller composes children + applies per-action gates at call site); prop-driven grows to 14+ props once a real surface ships (3 props × 5 actions minimum) and forces compound-gate logic into the wrapper's API. Canonical-order discipline preserved by call-site convention + wrapper docstring. Breakpoint: ~4 actions / 10 props. **Changed** `commands/copilot-loop.md` — First-run calibration block upgraded from "empirically TBD" to partially-confirmed: dual identity confirmed (`Copilot` on `/requested_reviewers`, `copilot-pull-request-reviewer[bot]` on `/reviews`), `remove+add IS required` for retrigger (bare `--add-reviewer` against an already-requested reviewer is a no-op), clean-signal phrasing still TBD pending an in-the-wild cleared review. New Failure-mode block documents Copilot service-error reviews (body literally `"Copilot encountered an error..."`, `state=COMMENTED`, zero inline comments) — 2 consecutive errors → stop retriggering this cycle, 3 consecutive → hand back. Phase 1 + Phase 3 retrigger descriptions updated to match the empirical confirmation. **Added** new section in both `commands/bugbot-loop.md` (authoritative copy) and `commands/copilot-loop.md` (brief stub + cross-link per the existing engine-sibling-fork convention) — **Multi-engine sync rule**: when the user invokes both `/bugbot-loop` AND `/copilot-loop` on the same PR, each cycle waits for the slowest engine, batches findings from both into ONE fix commit, pushes once, retriggers both; per-engine scratch-file state (`last_seen_<engine>_review`, per-engine `no_progress_map`); trade-off escape hatch (>15min bugbot CHECKRUN in_progress; 2× consecutive Copilot service-errors; bugbot CLEAN + Copilot hung past idle-poll budget); per-engine retrigger discipline (bugbot via `bugbot run` comment; Copilot via remove+add); hand-back report distinguishes "one-engine cleared" from "both cleared". Rationale: each push invalidates pending reviews of the prior SHA — without sync, the engines compound waste re-scanning each other's invalidated reviews. Sourced from the same downstream sprint that surfaced the cotton traps; the multi-engine sync rule emerged from user direction at the start of the loop plus observed engine stalls during the run. Curator pass caught a contradiction between the post-compound calibration block ("`remove+add IS required`") and Phase 3's pre-existing "empirically TBD" caveat — fixed in the same PR so the file no longer presents two confidence levels for the same observation. (2026-05-18, [#122](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/122))

- **Changed** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` — generalized **Step 4b: Version-bump consideration** as a project-agnostic step that fires whenever a version source is discoverable. First-match detection across `VERSION` / `pyproject.toml` / `package.json` / `Cargo.toml` / `setup.py` / versioned `CHANGELOG.md` (`## v<N>` or Keep-a-Changelog `## [<N>]` headers); four positive bump-triggers (architectural pivot, adopter-surface promise, compatibility cliff, 3+ cohesive features bundled) and four negative triggers (single refactor, bugfix-only, isolated tool, internal-only); patch-bump policy detection for strict-semver projects; sprint-auto `--scope=idea-only` skip rule (per-IDEA wraps never bump — integration-branch batch wrap is the single moment to consider the cohort). Self-mode CHANGELOG section now points at Step 4b instead of duplicating prose. **Added** retroactive `## 2026-05-18` wrap for PR #120 (`scripts/install-wsl.ps1`) — CHANGELOG entry under `## 2026-05` documenting the 17-cycle multi-engine review story; README's `scripts/` description broadened to cover OS-bootstrap helpers; ONBOARDING Windows-host primer added ahead of Claude Code setup. (2026-05-18, [#121](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/121))

- **Changed** `docs/README.md` replaced (~300L) with a tight directory index of the actual `docs/` surface — top-level guides + working subdirectories + tooling pointer + authoring conventions cross-link. **Removed** `docs/archive/archived_skills/` (6 pre-refactor monolithic Django skill bodies) and `docs/archive/refactoring/0001_django_skill_refactoring/` (9 planning docs from the same refactor) — both reachable via `git log -- <path>` if ever needed; carrying them in the working tree was noise with zero inbound refs. Net `+23 / -6727` lines. (2026-05-18, [#119](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/119))

- **Changed** `skills/django/SKILL.md` Phase 3 of IDEA-002 skill-debloat — four large inline sections had their bodies extracted into new `skills/django/references/` files: `CROSS_ENTITY_SESSION_FILTER.md` (78L: fan-out invalidation when a cross-entity field's change leaves derived per-entity session state stale across sibling entries; full `_clear_tags_from_other_entity_sessions` helper + two safety gates + canonical four-step test contract), `FILEFIELD_MIME_CAPTURE.md` (54L: `FieldFile.content_type` is empty by design — `__getattr__` doesn't delegate; capture browser MIME at upload via `self.file.file.content_type` + import-time `assert` locking the canonical MIME set against consumer-dict drift), `ENV_DRIVEN_ALLOWLISTS.md` (53L: `frozenset` parsed from comma-separated env var with five earn-their-keep details — replace-not-extend semantics, normalise-on-parse, `filter(None)` empty-strip, `frozenset` immutability against handler `.add()`, extensionless-filename guard), `MANIFEST_STATIC_FILES_STORAGE.md` (50L: `staticfiles.json` is in-memory cached for the worker's lifetime so `collectstatic` alone is insufficient; `make static && make restart-web` is the contract; same shape as env-var change-then-recreate). Originally-audited candidates LLM output post-processing (39L) and ORM optimisation (42L) intentionally skipped per per-section judgment — both below the comfortable-extraction threshold given their heterogeneity. Each extracted section survives in SKILL.md as a 2-paragraph stub naming firing conditions + the trap shape + the fix shape + a load-on-demand pointer. SKILL.md body shrank 802 → 597 lines (-26%, -205L). **Closes IDEA-002** — three phases, twelve new references emitted across `wrap/`, `django-frontend/`, `django/` skill trees: **748L total saved across 2,268L of original SKILL.md bodies (-33%)**. Token cost reclaimed per skill activation roughly proportional to the body savings — meaningful at sprint-auto-scale invocation rates. (2026-05-09, [#110](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/110))

- **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` Phase 2 of IDEA-002 skill-debloat — five large inline sections had their bodies extracted into new `skills/django-frontend/references/` files: `APP_SHELL_LAYOUT.md` (110L: fixed-viewport + per-pane-scroll layout primitives, "unstable child" `min-height: 0` rule, `scroll-utils.findScrollContainer` helper, document-scroll-migration regressions, render-and-assert test contract), `ALPINE_STORE_COORDINATORS.md` (84L: `onRegister` callback pattern with register-or-queue API replacing the timing-fragile `Alpine.effect`-poll-instance idiom; one-shot semantics + sync-or-deferred transparency + failure-isolation), `ACTIVE_STATE_TRACKING.md` (66L: `aria-current="true"` + CSS `:has()` instead of JS class-toggling for "currently selected" list items; single source of truth + free a11y + HTMX-swap-friendly), `TEMPLATE_COMMENT_SYNTAX.md` (43L: `{# inline #}` is single-line only; multi-line uses `{% comment %}`; content-leak failure mode + grep-based detection recipe), `SCSS_VENDOR_IMPORT.md` (39L: `@import url()` is runtime-not-compile-time; vendor CSS belongs in `<link>` tags resolved by `{% static %}`; failure mode triggered by app rename / `STATIC_ROOT` change). Sibling-trap section (27L) intentionally skipped per the plan's \<30L extraction-overhead-exceeds-savings threshold. Each extracted section survives in SKILL.md as a 2-paragraph stub naming firing conditions + the symptom + the fix shape + a load-on-demand pointer to the reference. SKILL.md body shrank 920 → 613 lines (-33%, -307L). Why: every `Skill django-frontend` invocation loads the full SKILL.md body into context; trim compounds across every Django+HTMX+Alpine project work session. Pattern matches Phase 1 (wrap SKILL.md) — verbatim section relocation + stub + References list entry. No architect-review pass this phase since the pattern was already validated by Phase 1's REQUIRES ABSTRACTION → integrated cycle. Phase 3 (`skills/django/SKILL.md` distributed bloat) deferred — lowest priority, harder per-section extraction judgment. (2026-05-09, [#109](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/109))

- **Changed** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Phase 1 of IDEA-002 skill-debloat — Steps 5 (worktree teardown), 7 (eval-gate emission), and 8 (atomic merge) had their detailed mechanics extracted from the SKILL.md body into three new `skills/wrap/references/` files: `WORKTREE_TEARDOWN.md` (destructive teardown sequence, per-file evaluation when `git worktree remove` refuses, last-of-batch integration cleanup for sprint-auto v3.1), `EVAL_GATE_EMISSION.md` (emission shell + placeholder substitution + Playwright-coverage pre-fill algorithm + MANUAL_EVAL_TRACKER hand-off), `ATOMIC_MERGE.md` (protected-branch detection + bugbot re-clearance + squash-merge sequence + permission-denial handling). Each step survives in SKILL.md as a 2-paragraph stub naming the firing conditions + skip cases + raison d'être, plus an inline pointer + References-list entry. SKILL.md body shrank 546 → 310 lines (-43%, -236L). Why: every `Skill wrap` invocation loads the full SKILL.md body into context, and `/wrap` is invoked twice per IDEA under sprint-auto (S5 pre-merge + S6/post-merge), so the trim compounds. Architect review (REQUIRES ABSTRACTION verdict) drove three substantive plan revisions: (a) `POST_MERGE_TEARDOWN` → `WORKTREE_TEARDOWN` — concept-scoped, not lifecycle-scoped (the "post-merge only" qualifier belongs in the SKILL.md stub, not the filename, so future relaxation of the gating doesn't rot the filename); (b) `ATOMIC_MERGE.md`'s body forward-references its own teardown step by reference name (`WORKTREE_TEARDOWN.md`) instead of by step number, applying the self-healing-naming discipline to internal forward-refs as well as filenames; (c) two architect-flagged "open questions" (subagent vs self-review for architect pass; whether to bundle IDEA-001 cleanup) collapsed into Key Technical Decisions because their defaults were foregone conclusions. Phase 2 (django-frontend, ~370L) and Phase 3 (django, distributed bloat) deferred to follow-up PRs after this PR's pattern validates. (2026-05-09, [#107](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/107))

- **Added** IDEA-001 Playwright Direction-1 plumbing — first `docs/ideas/IDEA-NNN.md`-tracked IDEA in mind-vault; established the per-project sprint-workflow precedent for mind-vault's own evolution. Nine deliverables: (1) `skills/sprint-auto/assets/setup_playwright.sh.template` — 638-line idempotent bootstrap script with auto-detection of multilingual locales + project-specific browser + base-URL + dev-image install path; (2-4) three new `skills/django-frontend/references/`: `HTMX_ALPINE_WAITS.md` (8 Playwright wait recipes for HTMX-request / HTMX-settling / Alpine-init combinations; the `r.request.headers.get('hx-request') == 'true'` filter shape — never `'htmx' in <header>.lower()`); `MULTI_TENANT_PLAYWRIGHT.md` (django-tenants fixtures with Host header injection vs /etc/hosts aliasing, schema_context-wrapped session.save for cookie pre-baking, per-tenant TRUNCATE cleanup since transactional_db rollback only covers public schema); `VISUAL_BASELINE_BUMPS.md` (AI agents NEVER pass `--update-snapshots` without explicit human directive; default-locale baselines with structural-only locale assertions for other locales); (5) **Added** three-branch IDEA-level `requires_playwright` gate orthogonal to `auto_safe` / `auto_safe_with_eval_gate`; never a sprint-auto disqualifier (downstream IDEAs flip to "present" after Direction-1 is adopted); (6) `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 7 gained the Playwright-coverage pre-fill algorithm — parses `playwright_test_coverage` YAML block from the plan doc, runs `make playwright-test --collect-only -q`, flips `[ ]` → `[x] (covered by ...)` for collectible tests + emits `_⚠️ rot:_` warning for non-collectible references; (7) `skills/wrap/assets/manual-evaluation-template.md` extended with playwright_test_coverage example block; (8) `agents/AGENT_architect.md` gained a /plan-time project probes section with YES/NO heuristic (UI primitives, keyboard nav, HTMX swaps → YES; backend, migrations, API contracts → NO); (9) **Changed** `commands/bugbot-loop.md` Phase 4 added watcher-hygiene pointer to `skills/work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md`. Plus a major **rules-reorg** that split `rules/` into two tiers — Tier A "always-on" (4 surviving rules: git-safety, self-sweep-before-push, rename-before-drop, cross-idea-amendments) vs Tier B "load on demand" (6 moved into `skills/<owner>/references/`: `RULE_parallel-worktree-docker` → sprint-auto/, `RULE_ideas-location-status` → idea/, `RULE_i18n-workflow` → django/, `RULE_orchestrator-trash-collection` → work/ (re-homed from sprint-auto/ per "trash collection is also for work skill" feedback), `RULE_tenant-scoped-fk-validation` → django/, `RULE_visual-baseline-bumps` → django-frontend/). 74 cross-references rewritten across 35 files. Saved ~983L / ~14K tokens off the per-session unconditional load. README.md split into "Rules (always-on)" + "Skill references (load on demand)" sections to document the curation criterion. (2026-05-09, [#106](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/106))

- **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/ROADMAP.md` revised to reflect the Direction-1 (in-stack Playwright) implementation shape — bootstrap-script-driven dev-image install over containerised browser approach, IDEA-level `requires_playwright` gate (orthogonal to safety gates, never a disqualifier), OSS-research corrections noting that `axe-playwright-python` ships an `Axe` class (not `inject` helper) + `pytest-playwright-visual-snapshot` (not `pytest-playwright-snapshot`). Set the architectural shape that PR #106 then implemented. ROADMAP later moved to `docs/archive/2026-05-idea-001-playwright-plumbing/ROADMAP.md` per the outcome-not-plan principle once the IDEA shipped. (2026-05-09, [#105](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/105))

- **Added** three `skills/django-frontend/references/` files compounding patterns from a multi-IDEA shell-frontend cohort — kept abstract in the reference bodies; provenance routed here per `feedback_skill_changelog_not_inline`. `PREVIEW_DRAWER_URL_STACK.md` — additive `?open=<base>&push=<f1>,<f2>,…` URL contract for round-tripping a megastack preview drawer's full state through the URL; 7-phase migration shape (server URL contract → frame body endpoints → seed dispatcher → client cold-start → URL sync → popstate diff → cross-IDEA backref); the popstate-without-persisted-state failure mode and its server-emitted `URL_PATTERN_BY_TYPE` JSON-island fix; `MAX_STACK_DEPTH=10` cap; bookmark-survival 302 from legacy detail URLs; the `|safe` filter is load-bearing on the JSON island. `SESSION_FILTER_PERSISTENCE.md` — per-entity vs cross-entity session split for multi-entity workspaces; `CROSS_ENTITY_FILTER_KEYS = ('scope', 'property', 'category')` survive entity navigation; per-entity (tags, q) clear on cross-link; `_filter_form=1` sentinel distinguishes real submits from cross-link nav so unrelated session keys don't get clobbered; scope-change → tags-clear fan-out across sibling entity sessions; `?clear=1` 302 preserves `?open=` / `?push=` while stripping the consumable param. `SHELL_NOTIFICATIONS.md` — `uiNotify` CustomEvent is the canonical toast dispatch for shell-bound modules; legacy `window.show*` family + direct `#messages-container` DOM writes paint full-width Bulma flash banners and are forbidden; server-side `ToastNotifyMiddleware` drains Django `messages.success/error` into the same `uiNotify` event via `HX-Trigger` merge — no double-dispatch; `HX-Trigger: <eventName>` pattern over `htmx:afterRequest` for `outerHTML`-swap targets that contain the trigger button (button detaches before bubble; body listener survives the swap); diagnostic grep recipes for both legacy patterns. **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` loader table to surface the three new optional extensions. **Changed** `skills/django/references/I18N_WORKFLOW.md` — new "Worked diagnostic recipe" sub-section under "Map Ownership Follows Template-Extraction Path": 3-step grep flow ((1) which app's `.po` file `makemessages` extracted into; (2) does that app's translation map have the entry; (3) do other maps have a misplaced duplicate) plus the logical-ownership traps that recur (shell-template button labelled with content-domain wording; shared infra JS calling into per-app modules; cotton components consumed across apps). Compounded from a consuming project's article list/detail shell migration (M2/M4/M15 closures): (a) the 7-phase preview-stack migration was a cross-IDEA amendment to an earlier preview-drawer foundation per `RULE_cross-idea-amendments`; (b) the original `cross_filters_<org_id>` / `<namespace>_<entity>_filters_<org_id>` split came from an earlier IDEA, this PR added the `_filter_form` sentinel + `?clear=1` redirect; (c) the `uiNotify` canonicalisation began with an earlier IDEA's toast primitive + `ToastNotifyMiddleware`, this PR's F.4 + F.7 swept five frontend modules onto it (`search-create-select.js`, `tiptap-widget.js`, `markdown-paste-upload.js`, `kb-actions.js`, `article_actions.js`) and shipped the `articleApproved` `HX-Trigger` pattern; (d) the i18n diagnostic was triggered by the same migration's M4 — `+ Article` workspace button entry sat in `kb.py` but template lives in `ui.py`, fourth recurrence of the pattern. (2026-05-08, [#104](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/104))

- **Added** `skills/mobile-ux-polish/SKILL.md` — progressive-disclosure skill carrying the five touch-and-scroll-snap patterns from a consuming project (drag-vs-tap dual-signal discriminator, `_dragPendingClear` deferred-clear vs wall-clock timeout, settle-timer debounce on scroll-snap state updates, cold-start `'instant'` vs runtime `'smooth'` `scrollIntoView`, state-lag on close-paths to preserve close animation). Initial PR-103 landing was as `RULE_mobile-ux-polish-discipline` (always-loaded tier); reshaped into a skill in the same PR — trigger surface (touch + scroll-snap + drawer + iOS quirks) is narrow enough that always-on context spend was the wrong tradeoff. Sibling patterns from the same cycle that apply beyond mobile work were routed to their proper homes rather than bundled under a "mobile" rubric: **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_PATTERNS.md` (added § Form focus preservation via list-scoped swap — sibling `hx-target` + `hx-select` retains form/IME/caret state across keystroke-driven swaps), **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md` (added gotcha #8 — rebind-on-event listener migration is fragile because change-events have edge cases that don't fire; prefer permanent-bind + active-discriminator gated at event time), **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/references/BASE_TEMPLATE.md` (added § CSS spec hazards: `min-height` > `max-height` clamp upward defeats Bulma/Bootstrap navbar collapse; added § Theme contrast picker (WCAG luminance) — sRGB-linearization required, gamma-encoded shortcut produces wrong picks for medium-tone backgrounds). **Added** `skills/wrap/references/MANUAL_EVAL_TRACKER.md` — process-artefact convention for the `MANUAL_EVAL_ISSUES.md` tracker that captures regression reports during multi-cycle manual-eval walks (stable `Mn` IDs, severity column, status-emoji + fix-SHA columns, multi-cycle history); `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 7 gains a one-paragraph pointer to introduce the tracker at first regression report. **Removed** `rules/RULE_mobile-ux-polish-discipline.md` (superseded by the skill). Compounded from a consuming project's PR — 60+ commits, 26-issue manual-eval cycle (M0–M25). (2026-05-07, [#103](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/103))

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` four new app-shell pattern sections (~340 lines): (A) **Cotton `:prop` coercion is opaque — prefer JSON seed for cold-start client state** — boolean+string coercion in cotton `:prop` is unreliable for non-string values; consume a single `<script type="application/json">` from Alpine init so cold-start and hot-open share the same code path; lock in a contract test asserting the cotton root carries exactly one `data-initial-*` attr. (B) **App-shell layout — fixed viewport + per-pane scroll containers** — `html.shell-html` scoping class so legacy non-shell pages stay on document-scroll; `min-height: 0` at every flex chain link ("unstable child" rule); shared `scroll-utils.findScrollContainer` helper; explicit acknowledgement that `window.scrollY` readers regress and need migration. (C) **Alpine.store coordinators with delayed-registered consumers — `onRegister` callback pattern** — replaces the timing-fragile `Alpine.effect`-poll-instance idiom with an explicit register-or-queue API; one-shot semantics, synchronous-or-deferred transparency, no monkey-patch stacking. (D) **Active-state tracking — `aria-current="true"` + CSS `:has()` instead of JS class toggling** — single source of truth on the link element; CSS targets the row via `:has()`; HTMX-swap-friendly; free a11y. **Changed** `tools/find_bugbot_comments.sh` to accept clean-signal from the GitHub `/check-runs` API as well as `/reviews` — bugbot can post clean signal as a successful check-run (`app.slug='cursor'`, `conclusion='success'`) with `/reviews` staying empty for that commit; tool now fetches `commits/<HEAD_SHA>/check-runs` as a 4th endpoint, emits `BUGBOT_CHECKRUN=` markers, and synthesises `BUGBOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL=checkrun-<id>` when check-run reports success AND `/reviews` produced no clean signal for HEAD; downstream consumer contract (the `^BUGBOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL=` grep) is unchanged. Tolerant filter matches `app.slug` / `app.owner.login` / `name` containing 'cursor' or 'bugbot' — hardcoded `'cursor[bot]'` would break under bot-metadata drift. Compounded from a consuming project (preview-drawer megastack + per-pane scroll containment); the check-runs source-of-truth was discovered when a `/bugbot-loop` poll wasted ~35 min waiting for a signal that lived in `/check-runs` instead. (2026-05-06, [#102](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/102))

- **Changed** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` adds Step 8 — atomic squash-merge via `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch` after a bugbot re-clearance, **conditional on the PR's target being non-protected** (anything that isn't `main` / `production` / `deployment`). Protected targets keep the existing human-merge HITL gate untouched. Step includes: protected-branch detection list (with `WRAP_AUTO_MERGE_DEPLOYMENT=1` override), bugbot re-clearance gate (wrap commits invalidate prior clean signal because HEAD SHA changed; re-trigger + wait; `WRAP_SKIP_BUGBOT_RECLEAR=1` opt-out for pure-docs wraps), squash-merge command + post-merge target-branch pull + Step 5 worktree teardown unblock, permission-denial fallback (gh denies → hand back PR URL, wrap commits already pushed). **Changed** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` description, intro, scope-mode control table, interaction rules, References — all updated to reflect Step 8. **Changed** `skills/work/SKILL.md` — section 5 (Verification and handoff) explicitly chains `/work → /bugbot-loop → /wrap`; sections 6 + 6a (frontmatter flip + archive README) demoted to "fallback when /wrap was bypassed", canonical owner is `/wrap`. Why: the previous default split a single IDEA's shipping moment into two operator turns for no safety reason — `RULE_git-safety`'s HITL gate is "merge into a protected branch", not every merge; sprint-auto already does atomic-merge at the multi-IDEA scale (S11.10 → S11.12 → integration merge = ONE shipping moment for the batch); single-IDEA `/wrap` should follow the same principle. Surfaced in a consuming project's PR — wrap initially refused to merge claiming `RULE_git-safety` prohibited it; re-reading the rule confirmed `gh pr merge` is forbidden ONLY when the target is protected, and that PR targeted a non-protected sprint branch. (2026-05-06, [#101](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/101))

- **Added** `skills/work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md` — orchestrator agents arming `run_in_background` Bash watchers to poll external state (PR reviews, CI, deploy progress, log lines) accumulate trash if those watchers aren't explicitly retired when superseded or when their reason-to-poll resolved. Hard rules: explicit `TaskStop` on supersede (don't rely on TIMEOUT — and per project convention, watchers and test-running shells must NOT carry hard wall-clock timeouts because large test suites legitimately take 30+ minutes); explicit stop when the reason-to-poll resolves (don't rely on a subtle exit condition firing correctly); cwd hygiene for auto-detect tools (`cd` belongs INSIDE the watcher's loop body, not before it arms — bash subshell cwd doesn't persist between separate `run_in_background` invocations); avoid self-matching `pgrep -f` exit conditions (the watcher's own argv contains the pattern; `pgrep -f` always sees its caller; use `pgrep -x` or `pgrep -f … | grep -v $$` or prefer Monitor / file-tail / task-completion notification); optional session-end `tasks/` sweep. Surfaced in a consuming project's sprint-auto run — orchestrator left ~18 background watchers superseded but not explicitly stopped over the course of an overnight run; one watcher with a self-matching `until ! pgrep -f 'compose exec.*pytest.*<app>/tests'` exit condition hung **5 hours 45 minutes** before the user surfaced it the next morning. The first-pass version of this rule prescribed a TIMEOUT bound on every watcher; user correction: "that shell is running soon 5h44min so timeout is definitely not working. and we have a rule NOT to setup timeouts because they might break large test suite prematurely. all good, just need effective garbage collection." Revised rule drops the TIMEOUT prescription and makes explicit-stop-by-orchestrator the sole cleanup mechanism, with self-match avoidance added as a sibling failure mode. (2026-05-06, [#100](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/100))

- **Added** `skills/django/references/TENANT_SCOPED_FK_VALIDATION.md` — validate-and-prune FK helpers that walk heterogeneous FK kinds (some tenant-schema, some public/shared-schema with `org_id`) MUST explicitly `.filter(org_id=org_id)` on the public-schema queries. Schema routing protects only tenant-schema models; helpers running outside tenant context (signals, celery tasks without `tenant_context()`, management commands, periodic sweepers) and helpers processing session payloads from a foreign tenant both bypass schema isolation when relying on it implicitly. Pattern: per-kind `tenant_scope_required` boolean in the `fk_specs` tuple, conditional `.filter(org_id=org_id)` applied when the flag is set — makes the schema-vs-public distinction reviewable at the call site instead of being implicit in the developer's memory of which model lives where. Includes a When-NOT-to-Apply section (tenant-schema models have no `org_id` — adding the filter raises `FieldError`; querysets already produced by tenant-scoped managers like `request.user.org.scope_set.filter(...)` are already explicitly scoped; single-tenant projects don't have the concept), Diagnostic Recipe (`rg -n 'objects\.filter\(id__in=' --type=py | grep -iE 'prune|exist|valid|sanit|clean'`), Anti-Patterns. **Changed** `skills/django/SKILL.md` § *Multi-tenancy vs. ForeignKey boundaries* — one-paragraph back-reference + link added. Compounded from a consuming project's PR cycle 2 (bugbot review 4232905213, fix commit `f1cca20c`) — `_prune_stale_fk_filters` queried `Scope` and `Property` (both `OwnedModel`, public schema, has `org_id`) by `id__in` only while `Category` and `Tag` queries (both tenant-schema, no `org_id`) were correctly schema-isolated; cross-tenant ids in session counted as "valid" and survived pruning, producing an empty-list-no-toast regression for any foreign-tenant id. (2026-05-06, [#99](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/99))

- **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` adds a third frontmatter opt-in mode `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true` — lets sprint-auto run a UX / a11y / interaction-heavy IDEA all the way through `/plan → /work → /bugbot-loop → /wrap → /bugbot-loop → integration` without pausing, while emitting a per-IDEA manual-evaluation checklist that the human walks at integration-PR-merge time. The merge gate stays at the protected branch per `RULE_git-safety`; eval-gate just **structures** the review residue rather than gating implementation. Required frontmatter: `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true` + `eval_gate_reason: <one-sentence>` (alongside the existing `auto_safe_reason`). **Added** `skills/wrap/assets/manual-evaluation-template.md` — project-agnostic template with placeholders for surface, scenarios, and cross-cutting checks (focus trap, screen reader, animation, z-index, reduced-motion, high-contrast, mobile gesture). **Changed** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 7 — eval-gate emission, pre-merge only, frontmatter-driven, no `--mode` flag; `--scope=idea-only` mode now includes Step 7. **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/references/safety-gates.md` — Mode A / Mode B sections with the required-frontmatter contract; disqualifier table updated. **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/references/integration-stage.md` — `[INTEGRATION]` PR body composition grows a `## Per-IDEA evaluation checklists` section listing each emitted checklist's URL; auto-run-log fields gain `eval_gate_idea_count` + `eval_checklists_emitted`. **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/references/post-pr-sequence.md` S5 gains step 3 (eval-gate emission); S11.10 notes the PR-body aggregation. **Replaced** `skills/sprint-auto/ROADMAP.md` with a design plan for headless Playwright in the dev image — the per-surface tests, when they exist, will pre-fill rows in the IDEA's eval-checklist (`Walked: [x] (covered by tests/playwright/...)`) and shrink the manual-walk surface; eval-gate adapts as automation grows rather than disappearing. Direction 1 (Playwright) is documented but not implemented in this PR. Why: previously, every UX / a11y / visual-regression IDEA disqualified itself from sprint-auto because the implementation could be done unattended but the review couldn't; eval-gate splits the unblock from the never-blocked. (2026-05-05, [#98](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/98))

- **Added** `rules/RULE_cross-idea-amendments.md` — shipped IDEAs are not stones; amend freely as conditions change (any later IDEA whose work needs to modify a shipped earlier IDEA's files just does it, no "supersede + new IDEA" cycle, no size caps, no single-file rules). The only invariant is **bidirectional documentation** — amending commits tag direction in the message, refresh the inline comment on the amended file to point at the amending IDEA, append a one-line backref into the amended IDEA's archive directory, and surface in `/compound` if the amendment pattern is itself reusable. Retires the earlier "bound the precedent" framing the rule had on first draft; user direction (a consuming project, 2026-05-05): "implemented ideas are not stones". **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md` — gotcha 6 (JS clobbers cotton-rendered translations: three fix patterns — `_captureDefaults` snapshot at boot, `_captureLoadingIndicator` per-action, `data-i18n-*` attrs on the cotton root; bugbot frequently misdiagnoses this class as "missing translation map entry", verify catalog state first), gotcha 7 (event listeners installed before a refusable gate leak on refusal — fix: install the listener AFTER the gate, generalises beyond modals to any `(install, check, return)`-shaped function). **Changed** `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` PASS 2 amendment — real symptom + wrong diagnosis is its own failure mode (the symptom IS real, the proposed root cause IS wrong); cross-references gotcha 6. **Changed** `skills/compound/SKILL.md` § auto-memory routing rule — auto-memory is **this-machine-only** (doesn't sync across the user's workstation + remote VPS sprint-auto + laptop); default to mind-vault for any cross-machine value. User direction: "mind-vault survives the machine". **Added** `skills/sprint-auto/references/HANDOFF_2026-05-05_eval_gate_amendment.md` — handoff doc proposing the `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true` mode (implemented in PR #98). Compounded from a consuming project's PR (modal primitives consolidation) — 3 bugbot cycles + 1 user-reported regression + architect review surfaced the patterns. (2026-05-05, [#97](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/97))

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/references/HTMX_SCROLL_PRESERVATION.md` — full primitive doc for the Load-older / inverse-pagination class of UI. Three approaches catalogued: (A) `scrollHeight` diff (breaks under concurrent below-marker mutations like websocket appends); (B) `previousElementSibling.offsetHeight` summation (silently zero when the prepend subtree contains a `display: contents` wrapper — CSS spec: no box → `offsetHeight=0`); (C) marker `offsetTop` diff (recommended — robust to `display: contents` AND nesting depth AND concurrent below-marker mutations). Reference implementation, robustness checklist, intentional non-features, test pattern (markup-level unit + manual E2E since JSDOM doesn't compute layout). Generalises beyond HTMX: any DOM math walking `previousElementSibling` summing `offsetHeight` is fragile to `display: contents` wrappers — `offsetTop`-diff is the more robust idiom. Anchor case: bugbot HIGH on a consuming project's PR. (2026-05-04, [#96](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/96))

- **Changed** `skills/django/references/I18N_WORKFLOW.md` — new section "Map Ownership Follows Template-Extraction Path" for projects using per-app sharded translation maps (`tools/translation_maps/<app>.py`). The map a string belongs in is determined by which app's `.po` file `makemessages` extracts the msgid to, NOT by which app the string "logically" belongs to — `fill_empty_po.py` for app-A's catalog only loads `A_TRANSLATIONS` from `<app-A>.py`; entries in `<app-B>.py` are dead even if the string was authored for app-A surfaces. Includes diagnostic recipe (`grep -l 'msgid "X"' web/*/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/django.po`), structural fix (cut + paste between map files + re-fill), and the deeper tension acknowledged: shared cotton components / shared partials with embedded `{% trans %}` force translations into every consuming app's catalog — duplicate map entries are the price for the AI-token/performance optimisation the per-app shape provides. Surfaced 3× in a consuming project's sprint (toast-pipeline cycle 7, cotton-primitives ui→auth duplicates, and an inverse-pagination cycle 1 finding `3183742934`). (2026-05-04, [#96](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/96))

- **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md` extended 3 → 5 entries. (#4) `hx-on::*` runs in plain JS scope, NOT Alpine's evaluator — three bridge patterns documented (Alpine.$data, x-on:htmx:after-request.camel, plain DOM); plain DOM recommended when the consumer just needs "show this hidden region after the HX response and let downstream components read its content." (#5) `hx-trigger="click once"` doesn't fire on synthetic state changes — drive lazy-fetch from a state-watcher (`x-effect`) with `open && !loaded` exactly-once guard; covers the auto-expand-from-hash + lazy-fetch combo silent failure. **Changed** `rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md` — new "Contract-Change Sweep" section: distinct trigger from the touched-files sweep — when a shared helper's return type, signature, or thrown exceptions change, grep ALL callers in the SAME commit; per-N decision rule (≤5 callers atomic; larger → backwards-compat shim window). **Added** `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` Common Patterns #17/#18/#19 — Alpine reactive state inside `hx-on::*` doesn't propagate (cross-refs gotcha #4), `hx-trigger="click once"` doesn't fire on synthetic state (cross-refs gotcha #5), Contract-change sweep (cross-refs the new RULE section). Compound from a consuming project's PR (c-collapsible + c-copy-button cotton primitives). (2026-05-04, [#95](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/95))

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/references/ALPINE_HTMX_GOTCHAS.md` — three subtle Alpine 3 + HTMX bridge behaviours: (1) Alpine 3 auto-calls `init()` on factory `x-data`; explicit `x-init="init()"` causes double-init (double-listeners, double-side-effects); (2) HTMX wraps non-raw-object `HX-Trigger` values in `{value, elt}` — listeners that assume the array IS the detail get `undefined`; (3) HTML spec runs defer scripts BEFORE `DOMContentLoaded` — handlers bound in a DOMContentLoaded callback miss HTMX-init events. Each is silent (no error, no warning); each took ≥30 minutes to diagnose. **Added** `rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md` — pyflakes on touched Python files between bugbot-loop's Phase 2 (apply edits) and Phase 3 (commit + push + retrigger) saves 5-10 min of bugbot-cycle wall-time per trivial dead-import / unused-local finding; ≤10 mechanical edits roll into current PR, >10 → separate cleanup PR. **Added** `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` pattern #16 — middleware that drains the Django messages framework on HTMX responses must gate on response status (skip 3xx); XHR follows redirects transparently so any `HX-Trigger` on the 302 is never seen by the browser AND draining sets `used=True` which clears persisted state for the next request → silent loss of every `messages.success`/`error` from HTMX form-then-redirect flows. **Changed** `skills/django/references/I18N_WORKFLOW.md` — new pitfall row for orphaned translations: translation maps shipping msgids that have no `_()` / `gettext_lazy(...)` source in `web/` are dead at runtime; `makemessages` only extracts what the AST contains, so map entries without a Python source never reach the `.po` files. Compound from a consuming project's PR (toast-primitive pipeline). (2026-05-04, [#94](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/94))

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` — two new sections compounded from a consuming project's PR (shell base layout + `<c-drawer>` primitive). (1) **Alpine.js script load order — defer microtask trap**: `alpine.min.js` auto-starts via `queueMicrotask(() => Alpine.start())` the moment its own defer task finishes, BEFORE subsequent defer scripts execute. Any `Alpine.data(name, factory)` registration or `addEventListener('alpine:init', …)` listener in a later defer script registers too late — Alpine has already walked the DOM and emitted `Alpine Expression Error: <factory> is not defined` for every `x-data` expression. Fix: load Alpine-factory-bearing shell-bundle JS as **blocking** `<script>` tags (no `defer`) in the document `<head>` so registration runs synchronously before alpine's defer task is scheduled. (2) **Toggleable containers — `inert` not `aria-hidden`**: WAI-ARIA spec forbids focused descendants under aria-hidden ancestors; flipping `:aria-hidden="(!isOpen).toString()"` to `"true"` while a button retains focus fires a browser a11y warning (`Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus`). Use the `inert` HTML attribute (Chrome 102+ / Firefox 112+ / Safari 15.5+) — proactively blurs descendants AND hides from a11y tree AND blocks pointer events. Single-attribute swap: `:aria-hidden="(!isOpen).toString()"` → `:inert="!isOpen"`. Plus a caution note hoisting the rule that every key any descendant references in the root `x-data` initializer must be declared (missing keys throw at runtime, not at template-compile time). (2026-05-04, [#93](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/93))

- **Added** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 3 — **Decisions Recap section** for multi-IDEA cohorts (~10+ IDEAs sharing context). Living top-of-file index in `docs/ideas/README.md` placed between `## 🚧 In Progress` and `## 💡 High Priority`: ~50-line section with sprint-progress status table + numbered cross-cutting architectural decisions block + per-topic source-of-truth artefact links. Solves the "re-reading 25 plan docs to remember what was decided" pain. Maintenance contract: `/plan` appends rows + flips status when an IDEA enters in-progress, `/wrap` flips rows to ✅ + appends decisions, batch wrap rolls them into one commit on the integration branch. Cross-reference added to `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` S11.7 so the integration-branch batch wrap maintains the recap when the cohort is large. Genesis: a consuming project's 25-IDEA sprint cohort (2026-05) — context cost crossed a pain threshold. (2026-05-04, [#93](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/93))

- **Changed** `skills/django/SKILL.md` footer — follow-up trim of the heavy `**Last Updated**` parenthetical narrative + `**Previous**:` line that PR #90 introduced (the carve-out from PR #91's sweep). Now carries a bare `**Last Updated**: 2026-05-01` line; the cross-entity session-filter narrative is already captured in PR #90's CHANGELOG entry, so nothing is lost. (2026-05-02, [#92](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/92))

- **Changed** five skill/rule footers — second-wave trim of `**Last Updated**` parenthetical narrative + `**Previous**:` lines that accumulated after PR #86's first sweep. `skills/sprint-auto/references/PARALLEL_WORKTREE_DOCKER.md`, `rules/RULE_rename-before-drop.md`, `skills/idea/references/IDEAS_LOCATION_STATUS.md`, `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md`, `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` each now carry a bare `**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD` line; the incident narrative was already in the corresponding CHANGELOG entries (PRs #82, #69, #46, #88), so no history is lost. Token-cost driver: every line in skills/rules is paid for on each activation. New auto-memory entry codifies that future skill/rule edits route incident detail to CHANGELOG, never inline. (2026-05-02, [#91](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/91))

- **Added** `skills/django/SKILL.md` "Cross-entity session-filter state — fan-out invalidation on shared-key change" section — covers the two-key cross/entity session split + the trap where a cross-field's value change leaves derived state stale on sibling per-entity entries; concrete `_clear_tags_from_other_entity_sessions` helper shape; both gates (`old_scope_value` truthy + `isinstance(key, str)` defence) explained. **Added** `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` reviewer-context fan-out heuristic. Compounded from a consuming project's smoke-test edge-case where switching scope on /events/ left stale tag IDs from /articles/ — user landed back on /articles/ with no UI to de-select, 0 results. (2026-05-02, [#90](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/90))

- **Changed** CHANGELOG promotion — PR #86 entries moved from `## Unreleased` into the `## 2026-04` dated section; new `## 2026-05` section opened with bullets for PRs #87 + #88. Self-mode `/wrap` housekeeping. (2026-05-01, [#89](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/89))

- **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` + `skills/sprint-auto/references/integration-stage.md` — v3.2 integration-branch-as-merge-gate. Per-IDEA PRs target the integration branch via `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_BRANCH` instead of the parent (main / sprint-\*); the `[INTEGRATION]` PR becomes non-draft and is the SINGLE merge gate the human reviews + merges; per-IDEA PRs auto-close as merged ancestors. Forward-sync (S11.11) and per-PR re-bugbot (S11.12) deleted entirely — they only existed to compensate for v3.1's parent-targeted PR routing. v3.2 preserves atomic-batch merging (single integration-PR merge ships the whole batch) without v3.1's "N identical PRs all carrying the same diff" UX cost flagged by the reviewer on a consuming project's sprint cohort. Compounded from a consuming project's PRs. (2026-05-01, [#88](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/88))

- **Changed** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` — new "Critical hazards (read these first)" section right after "When to use" hoists three high-blast-radius template traps into the skill's first 100 lines so they hit the agent's context before any template edits: multi-line `{# … #}` content leak (cross-refs the full section from [#74](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/74)), Django tag literals inside JS `//` comments ([#78](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/78)), and a new full section **SCSS vendor-import hazard — `@import url()` is runtime, not compile-time**: Sass copies `@import url('../vendor.css')` verbatim into compiled CSS; the browser resolves the relative URL at runtime against the compiled CSS file's URL — when the compiled CSS path moves (app rename, `STATIC_ROOT` change), the vendor file 404s in production even though Sass compiled cleanly. Vendor CSS belongs in a `<link>` in base.html. First-100-lines placement is the fix because cross-refs alone were insufficient — IDEA-136 PR #409 shipped four multi-line `{# %}` blocks two hours after a cotton-section cross-ref was authored. Compounded from a consuming project's sprint cohort. (2026-05-01, [#88](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/88))

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` Cotton components pattern — `<c-foo />` syntax, file layout (per-app `templates/cotton/` + shared-UI-app convention), Django settings (`SimpleAppConfig` + explicit loaders + builtins; avoid double-config vs default `LoaderAppConfig`), call-site colon-prefix for Python expressions vs literal strings, render-and-assert test pattern (`engines['django'].from_string` + whitespace-normalised `EXPECTED_*` literals + future-pinned fixture dates), when-to-use-vs-`{% include %}` decision matrix. Anti-patterns cross-reference the existing template-comment-syntax + SCSS-vendor-import sections; each is a real bug witnessed in a consuming project's sprint-auto run (cotton component crash on multi-line `{# %}`, UI break after a sibling IDEA's SCSS relocation, double-registration risk caught by bugbot). Cotton coexists with `{% include %}` — opportunistic migration only, no big-bang rewrite. Compounded from a consuming project. (2026-05-01, [#87](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/87))

## 2026-04

- **Changed** every `skills/**/SKILL.md` and reference footer — stripped `**Last Updated**` parenthetical narrative + stacked `**Previous**:` lines so each file carries a bare `**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD` instead. Per-skill revision history was being loaded into context on every activation; CHANGELOG.md is now the single source of narrative history. `skills/skill-writer/SKILL.md` policy updated to forbid in-skill changelogs (Body-structure item 6 + Maintaining-skills bullet now point callers at CHANGELOG). Backfills PRs #81–#85 into the dated section in the same pass. PR #86 carries the bloat sweep + scrub gate + signature-drift probe + DRF request-less serializer context compound. (2026-04-30, [#86](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/86))

- **Added** sidecar `VERSION` files for the three feature-dense skills (`skills/django/`, `skills/deployment/`, `skills/django-frontend/`) that previously carried `**Version**: X.Y` lines in their footers. Sidecar over frontmatter because Anthropic's official Agent Skills spec defines no `version` field — adding a frontmatter `version:` would conflict the day a standard lands. The sidecar file is invisible to the host agent at activation time (zero context cost), grep-friendly, and trivially removable. `skills/skill-writer/SKILL.md` documents the convention under Maintaining skills with the "only where 'what edition am I reading?' actually arises" threshold. (2026-04-30, [#86](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/86))

- **Added** `skills/compound/SKILL.md` mandatory customer-data scrub gate before mind-vault commits — Step 5 in mind-vault promotion + interaction rule. Compounded meta-from a consuming project's PR where the first compound pass leaked a tenant slug + conversation id into a mind-vault skill provenance footer; user caught it pre-push and the gate codifies the scrub. The "would this be safe in a public repo today?" test is the explicit gate — mind-vault is private today but treating it as eventually-public eliminates the data-leak class entirely. (2026-04-30, [#86](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/86))

- **Added** `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` Step 6 checklist line for "function/method signature drift in reference doc". Compounded from a consuming project's PR where Step 6 caught a stale `generate_presigned_url` signature in an external project's core reference doc that had been missing the `request=None` parameter live since commit `696f7563` (2026-04-23) — a week of drift before this wrap pass surfaced it. Signature changes don't fail tests, and parameters added "for one specific caller" rarely get propagated to the doc. (2026-04-30, [#86](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/86))

- **Changed** `skills/django/SKILL.md` DRF section — added "request-less serializer context" pattern (when `request` is unavailable, e.g. background tasks generating presigned URLs, pass `context={'request': None}` and have the serializer tolerate it via `.get('request')`). Compounded from a consuming project's PR where a Celery task constructing presigned download URLs blew up because its serializer required `request` in context. (2026-04-30, [#86](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/86))

- **Changed** `tools/find_bugbot_comments.sh` — surfaces `BUGBOT_LATEST_REVIEW=<id> COMMIT=<sha> AT=<ts> CLEAN=<true|false>` marker for the most recent bugbot review (regardless of clean state) and tags every inline finding with `(comment id <cid>, review <rid>)`. Lets `/bugbot-loop` distinguish active findings (latest review) from stale persistent threads (older reviews kept visible by GitHub UI until manually "Resolve conversation"-clicked) by `pull_request_review_id` rather than indirect signals. Compound from PR #80's bugbot-loop session: cycles 11/14/17/18 spent on findings already cleared from current HEAD because no review-id filter existed. `/bugbot-loop` Phase 1 staleness rule rewritten as the primary path, with the prior `last_seen_comment_id` heuristic kept as a fallback for not-yet-refreshed callers. (2026-04-28, [#81](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/81))

- **Changed** `skills/deployment/SKILL.md` — config-fingerprint gate added as second layer to `### Change detection`. File-diff answers "did anything in this area change?"; fingerprint answers "did the thing the expensive op actually depends on change?". File-diff is necessary but not sufficient when the expensive op depends on a subset of the files that flip the diff. Anchor case: a consuming project's 2026-04-28 dependabot bump of fastapi + google-genai. Plus a staging-PR smoke-testing runbook section in `skills/sprint-auto/references/PARALLEL_WORKTREE_DOCKER.md` covering the bind-mount-vs-COPY hybrid update workflow, revert path with `up -d --force-recreate` on COPY services to drop cp'd state, the `showmigrations` lies-on-checkout-back-to-main gotcha (DB-tracked migrations whose files aren't on the current branch are invisible but still applied), multi-tenant `django_migrations` query for verifying actual DB state. (2026-04-29, [#85](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/85))

- **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/` — forward-sync makes per-PR PRs co-dependent in atomic-batch sense: merging the first PR collapses the others' diffs to zero (they auto-close on next `gh pr view`). Reframed from a ⚠️ warning to a ✅ time-saver callout in `SKILL.md` interaction rule, `references/integration-stage.md`, and `assets/auto-run-log-template.md` — names the win on the happy path (one merge ships N IDEAs) and enumerates three escape hatches for the rare defer-one-IDEA escalation (close-and-rerun, surgical revert, accept atomic). Compounded from a consuming project's 2026-04-29 sprint where the reviewer merged the first PR and asked why a sibling PR's diff "looked weird" (it had collapsed to zero — design intent, not a bug). (2026-04-29, [#84](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/84))

- **Added** `skills/django/SKILL.md` — "Blankable CharField — `null=True` over `default=\"\"`" section right after BaseModel abstraction. Two load-bearing reasons: no empty-string sentinel ambiguity (`is None` is the one truthful unset check) + additive migrations need no default value. One explicit exception (synchronous `save()`-populated fields). DRF-side serializer implication (`allow_null=True` + `required=False` to honour the model contract). Compounded from a consuming project's Phase B work where `IndexableMixin.embed_failure_reason` first crystallised the convention. (2026-04-29, [#83](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/83))

- **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/references/PARALLEL_WORKTREE_DOCKER.md` — new Common Gotcha row "wrong stack down" covering chained `cd "$WORKTREE_VAR" && docker compose down` falling through to the primary stack when `$WORKTREE_VAR` is unset in that bash invocation (env vars don't carry between Claude Code Bash tool calls — only cwd does, and `cd ""` is a silent no-op, not a hard error). Witnessed during a consuming project's sprint-auto run S11.13 teardown — ~30s primary-stack outage. Defences: always `source` the state file before any chained `cd` to a worktree path, or use absolute paths literally, or gate with `: "${VAR:?...}"`. (2026-04-29, [#82](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/82))

- **Added** `tools/install-cursor.sh` — bundled installer for Cursor IDE (apt) + Cursor Agent CLI (user-scope). IDE installs from Cursor's official apt repo (`downloads.cursor.com/aptrepo`, signed by `keys/anysphere.asc`) — `apt upgrade` keeps it current. CLI delegates to the vendor curl-bash installer with privilege drop to `$SUDO_USER` so user-scope tarball lands in the right home. Detects "dirty" pre-existing installs (cursor present but apt source missing/wrong, or with stale `signed-by=` references to deleted legacy keyrings) and rewrites cleanly — scans by URL across `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/*.list`, `*.sources` (deb822), and inline `/etc/apt/sources.list` lines. `--check` / `--no-cli` flags. Pipefail-safe `cursor --version` capture (parameter expansion + `\|\| true`); rc-file scan for PATH hint instead of unreliable `sudo -u $USER bash -c 'echo $PATH'` (which returns sudo's `secure_path`). 9 bugbot fix-cycles + the architectural HIGH that flipped the script from a `.deb` redirect-resolution approach to the official apt repo. (2026-04-28, [#80](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/80))

- **Added** `skills/dependabot-triage/SKILL.md` — multi-ecosystem dup detection (pip workspaces spawn root + per-workspace PRs that may or may not be true duplicates — `gh pr diff` content compare, never title-based triage), risk-tier batching with per-dep commits so `git bisect` keeps per-package resolution post-squash-merge, version-scheme jumps (pre-1.0 → 1.x) get standalone PRs for bisect cleanliness, live-staging smoke for SDK bumps (test suites mock SDK clients; real-API smoke is the only verification that the new SDK shape works in production paths). Compound from a consuming project's 2026-04-28 dep sweep. (2026-04-28, [#79](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/79))

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` — sibling-trap section to PR #74's multi-line `{# #}` comment-leak: a literal `{% trans %}` (or any Django tag) inside a JS `//` comment raises `TemplateSyntaxError: 'trans' takes at least one argument` at template-compile time → 500 on every page that loads the template. Django's `{% %}` parser ignores surrounding language context — JS comments are invisible. Same root cause, different symptom (loud 500 vs silent text leak). Surfaced 2× during a consuming project's 2026-04-27 staging-tree manual test loop. (2026-04-27, [#78](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/78))

- **Added** `/sprint-auto` integration phase v3.1 — pre-batch state S(-1) bootstraps a single integration worktree at port offset `+30000` as the only docker stack of the entire batch; per-IDEA worktrees narrowed to code-surface-only (no `.env`, no docker), verification routes to integration worktree via `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE` env var; integration phase S11.5–S11.13 sequentially merges per-IDEA branches, runs batch wrap + union tests + full-suite tests + bugbot via `[INTEGRATION]` draft PR + forward-sync + re-bugbot; teardown at S11.13. Eliminates the structural N-way line-conflict on `docs/archive/YYYY-MM-DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` and `docs/ideas/README.md` that every parallel `/wrap` produced silently, plus surfaces cross-PR file-region conflicts (the IDEA-124/IDEA-125 12-file case) on the integration branch ahead of human-merge time. `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh` gains `--port-offset` flag (legacy idea-number-derived formula caps at +19900; integration phase needs +30000). Cross-skill plumbing in `skills/work/SKILL.md`, `skills/wrap/SKILL.md`, `commands/bugbot-loop.md`. (2026-04-27, [#77](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/77))

- **Added** `skills/sprint-auto/IDEA_integration_branch.md` — single-doc design capture for the integration-branch feature, combining IDEA framing (problem statement: every parallel `/wrap` collides on devlog/index lines + cross-PR conflicts only surface at human-merge time) with v3.1 implementation plan (locked Q4/Q5/Q6 decisions, single-stack architecture, DB reset between IDEAs, bugbot at every gate, port-offset math, S(-1) + S11.5–S11.13 state machine, naming distinguishing the new `integration/sprint-auto-<batch-iso>` worktree from project-level `staging`). Folded from a previous two-PR split (PR #75 closed, content merged here). Implementation in PR #77. (2026-04-27, [#76](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/76))

- **Added** `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` — "Template comment syntax — `{# inline #}` is single-line only" section. Multi-line `{# … #}` does NOT raise `TemplateSyntaxError` — Django's tokeniser fails to recognise the construct as a comment and emits the entire block as plain text into the rendered output. **No CI signal**. Visible "comment" text shown to end users until someone hits the affected page. Two-row decision table, three-state code example (correct inline / broken multi-line / correct `{% comment %}` multi-line), worked example, one-shot Python detection script for grepping codebases, CI-hook recommendation. Surfaced on a consuming project's 2026-04-27 staging tests. (2026-04-27, [#74](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/74))

- **Added** Six new pattern sections across `skills/django-frontend/SKILL.md` (audio playback feature-detection via `<audio>` `error` event, Alpine.js reactivity reassign-vs-delete, animation-loop pause on `visibilitychange`, server-template + JS render-helper contract) and `skills/django/SKILL.md` (env-driven allowlist `frozenset` pattern, LLM output post-strip strip-and-trust pattern). **Added** `skills/django/references/ASYNC_WEBSOCKET.md` Per-Message Resource Caps section — Channels-specific consumer-boundary cap pattern, cross-linked from `skills/django/SKILL.md` so it's reachable from both AI-patterns and WebSocket-patterns paths. Compound from a consuming project's 2026-04-26 overnight sprint-auto run. (2026-04-27, [#73](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/73))

- **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` interaction rules — `/bugbot-loop` invocations are MANDATORY; ship-non-clean is a fallback for the cap-hit / budget-exhausted case, NOT an upfront opt-out. Names invalid skip-the-attempt rationales ("overnight harness can't reliably wait for async polls", "would exceed wall-clock budget", "Cursor Bugbot is async"). Reminds that `/bugbot-loop` is itself bounded (180 min active, 20 idle polls, 20 commits) precisely so sprint-auto can fire-and-forget — the loop's own bounds enforce the time ceiling, and its hand-back findings are the *intended* path to a non-clean ship. Pre-existing release-valve rule reframed as corollary. Compound from a consuming project's 2026-04-26 sprint where the agent shipped six PRs without firing `/bugbot-loop` on any of them, citing "ship-non-clean is OK." (2026-04-26, [#72](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/72))

- **Added** `skills/plan/references/batching-for-sprint-auto.md` — opt-in `/plan` mode for batching N plans into one branch + PR to feed an overnight `/sprint-auto` run. Feature branch `docs/plans-sprint-batch-YYYY-MM-DD`, one commit per plan, sprint-auto sequences via `depends_on:` frontmatter on overlapping IDEAs, generic PR title/body template, `gh pr edit --body` workaround for the GraphQL projects-classic deprecation, hand-off contract (sprint-auto runs in fresh session, reads from disk, no chat-context dependency). **Added** `skills/django-frontend/references/vendoring-js-bundles.md` — when to vendor a JS library vs add a Node toolchain. Three production paths: Path A (UMD download from CDN — easiest), Path B (disposable `node:22-alpine` container for ESM-only libraries like TipTap), Path C (browser ESM importmap — generally rejected for production fragility). `BUILD_INFO.txt` hash drift-protection guardrail (architect F9 pattern), integration-glue contract (data-attr discovery, HTMX swap teardown, race-safe uploads via `AbortController` + active-editors check). Precedent: EasyMDE in a consuming project. Planned reuse: TipTap (a consuming project's later IDEA). (2026-04-26, [#71](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/71))

- **Changed** `tools/install-mosh-tmux.sh` managed `~/.tmux.conf` — adds IDE-coexistence customisations: prefix `C-b` → `C-a` (Antigravity / VS Code / Cursor grab `C-b` for sidebar toggle), `set-clipboard on` (OSC 52 emission, mosh-pass-through), prefix-less Alt-bindings (`Alt-\` / `Alt--` for splits with `pane_current_path` inheritance, `Alt-h/j/k/l` for vim-style pane nav, `Alt-w` for tab-close ergonomics), right-click menu unbinds (avoid double-overlay with IDE terminal context menu). Heredoc switched from unquoted to single-quoted (`<<'TMUXCONF'`) to avoid `\;` and `M-\\` double-escape footguns under unquoted-heredoc semantics. (2026-04-25, [#70](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/70))

- **Added** `rules/RULE_rename-before-drop.md` — canonical refactoring-runs commit sequence for refactors that rename then drop a symbol: AddField/new symbol → data-migrate / populate (bridge state) → rename references everywhere (every commit compilable) → full test pass (green-light gate; missed references surface as AttributeError) → drop old symbol (destructive moment, isolated) → re-test → docs/housekeeping. Per-commit compilability + bisectability + the test-pass between rename and drop is where missed references surface cleanly — bundled, they hide in post-drop noise. Worked example: a consuming project's `_COPY_FIELDS` omission in a recurrence module surfaced as 36 distinct `AttributeError` tests during the rename-only test pass. **Changed** `skills/django/SKILL.md` — verbose_name discipline section. Compound from a consuming project. (2026-04-25, [#69](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/69))

- **Changed** `skills/deployment/SKILL.md` — §Deployment session tracking strengthened: explicitly names plan + execution + verification as **one artefact** with `PENDING` pre-rollout status, preventing the plan-doc-plus-session-file fork that produced two-narrative drift in a consuming project (the standalone `ROLLOUT_PLAN_*.md` format, retired 2026-02-23). §Health checks gates the hard-coded `/api/health` probe behind `${HEALTH_URL:-/}` — generic `/api/health` 404'd during a consuming project's verification (no such endpoint), default to `/` (landing page 200) so every project works out of the box; projects with real JSON health endpoints set `HEALTH_URL`. 404 on liveness probe masks real signal — never hard-code without confirming the endpoint exists. **Changed** `skills/idea/SKILL.md` — sprint-auto opt-in gates (`auto_safe`, arg allowlist) at idea-capture time, not first-encounter time. Compound from a consuming project's 2026-04-24 production rollout. (2026-04-24, [#68](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/68))

- **Added** `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` Common Bugbot Patterns 9-13: iterable consumed twice in same call site (Python), Django template variable starts with underscore, chained `.filter()` / `.exists()` after queryset iteration (Django ORM N+1 trap), `isinstance(x, int)` accepts bools (Python `bool` subclass trap), HTMX `hx-swap-oob="true"` initial-render vs replacement-render class drift. Shell installer conventions section renumbered 9 → 14. The four Python+Django patterns are language- and framework-level traps generic to any project on the stack — adding them to the agent's proactive-check list means future bugbot loops should catch them earlier. Compound from a consuming project's sprint. (2026-04-23, [#67](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/67))

- **Changed** `skills/sprint-auto/references/PARALLEL_WORKTREE_DOCKER.md` — new section "Dev-tool install + config placement in a worktree stack". Two patterns: (1) installing dev-only pip deps via `pip install -r /dev/stdin < requirements-dev.txt` keeps the file as single source of truth instead of inlining versions in Makefile (avoids drift on next dep bump); (2) config files for container-resident tools (linters, scanners, security tools) belong under `tools/` (already bind-mounted at `/tools/`), not project root (which isn't reachable from `/app` inside the worktree's web container). Compound from a consuming project's automated-security-scanning work where bugbot flagged the version-duplication drift risk at MED severity. (2026-04-22, [#66](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/66))

- **Changed** `CHANGELOG.md` + `README.md` + `docs/guides/SPRINT_WORKFLOW.md` — catchup `/wrap` pass for PR #64 (which merged without its own CHANGELOG entry due to bootstrap paradox: the pre-merge wrap discipline shipped *by* #64 wasn't yet in force at #64's merge time). Adds bullet covering pre-merge default for `/wrap`, mode auto-detection (`gh pr view --json state` → OPEN/MERGED/CLOSED), pre-merge vs post-merge frontmatter-flip date source, destructive teardown pinned post-merge, doc-catchup = wrap-scope (not new-IDEA) with PLURAL_TRANSLATIONS worked example. `/wrap-docs` → `/wrap (pre-merge)` rename in README + SPRINT_WORKFLOW for #64's chosen spelling. (2026-04-22, [#65](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/65))

- **Changed** `/wrap` + `/sprint-auto` — pre-merge is the default for `/wrap`, doc-catchup for existing patterns is wrap-scope (not new-IDEA). `/wrap` now auto-detects mode via `gh pr view --json state`: `OPEN` → commit onto the feature branch (default), `MERGED` → `docs/idea-NNN-wrap` branch from `origin/main`, `CLOSED` → refuse. Step 2 frontmatter flip uses today's date pre-merge, `gh pr view --json mergedAt` post-merge. Step 5 destructive worktree teardown (`-v` + `git worktree remove` + branch delete) pinned to post-merge; non-destructive `docker compose down` stays in sprint-auto's S8. Step 6 adds a third disposition — "Patch now — documentation catch-up" — for docs-gaps discovered mid-wrap (PLURAL_TRANSLATIONS worked example); "this existing pattern isn't documented" is NOT a legitimate follow-up IDEA, it's a wrap patch-now. Sprint-auto's S5 now invokes `/wrap` directly (mode auto-detected) instead of the notional `/wrap-docs` subset; frontmatter flip + ideas-index move included in pre-merge wrap. Compound pass from a consuming project's PRs (a second wrap dogfood + the post-merge-wrap follow-up that wouldn't have been needed with pre-merge default). (2026-04-22, [#64](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/64))

- **Changed** `/sprint-auto` skill — full post-`/work` autonomy. After `/work` opens the PR, sprint-auto now drives `/bugbot-loop` on deliverables, auto-resolves T2/T3 escalations as revertable fresh commits, invokes `/wrap` (docs-only pre-merge subset) to commit DEVELOPMENT_LOG + downstream-docs updates to the same branch, runs a second `/bugbot-loop` on docs, tears down the docker stack (`down` without `-v`; volumes + worktree retained for review), and harvests compound candidates. Batch end: `/compound` per candidate + `/bugbot-loop` each mind-vault PR produced. Per-pass escalation caps calibrated to tail length — **20** deliverables, **5** docs, **5** mind-vault compound; each independent. Canonical failure-path invariant: every failure re-enters at S8 (teardown, no-op when nothing to tear down), S9 (harvest) + S10 (log) always run. HITL merge gate unchanged. New references `post-pr-sequence.md` (S0–S15 state machine) + `escalation-policy.md` (rollback discipline + per-pass caps + ship-non-clean contract); log template split into `deliverables_bugbot_outcome` / `docs_bugbot_outcome` + per-pass escalation-attempt tables. (2026-04-22, [#62](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/62))

- **Changed** `/sprint-auto` safety gates — dropped the `priority: high` check. Priority is queue order (scheduling preference), not a safety dimension. `auto_safe: true` remains the authoritative opt-in. Eliminates redundant gating that was failing low-priority-but-clearly-safe IDEAs at preflight. (2026-04-22, [#61](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/61))

- **Changed** `/wrap` skill — CHANGELOG (self-mode) and DEVELOPMENT_LOG (project-mode) end-to-end maintenance per invocation. Self-mode Step 4 preamble fetches merged + open PR lists (squash-merge-aware: `gh pr list --state merged`, not `git log --merges`); Step 1 promotes bullets from `## Unreleased` into current `## YYYY-MM` only when the bullet's PR is merged; Step 2 adds new entries for the just-merged PR directly to the dated section; Step 3 reconciles Unreleased against still-open PRs; Step 4 backfill-gap-detects ≤3 missed PRs and backfills in-wrap (larger gaps surface in hand-back). Project-mode extended symmetrically for monthly DEVELOPMENT_LOG files: preamble resolves the target file for the current month (rollover aware), backfill places each missed PR's bullet in the devlog for the month when THAT PR merged. Same discipline, both modes. (2026-04-22, [#60](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/60))

- **Added** `tools/install-mosh-tmux.sh` — resilient-SSH installer for spotty links. Installs mosh + tmux on Debian/Ubuntu, writes a marker-bounded `~/.tmux.conf` with truecolor + scrollback + mouse defaults, adds an SSH-only auto-attach snippet to `~/.bashrc`, opens UDP 60000:61000 in UFW when active. `--check` / `--no-ufw` / `--no-autoattach` / `--no-tmux-config` / `--session-name` / `--target-user` flags. (2026-04-22, [#59](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/59))

- **Added** `skills/deployment/references/SHELL_INSTALLERS.md` — canonical authoring + review reference for `tools/install-*.sh` scripts. 15 patterns distilled from bugbot review cycles across PRs #55 (install-gcloud-cli), #58 (wrap SKILL chown fallback), #59 (install-mosh-tmux): the `set -eo pipefail` family (pipeline-in-assignment silent abort, `head -N` SIGPIPE race), `chown 'user:'` vs `'user:user'`, marker-block regex-metacharacter hazards + unclosed-sed-range EOF truncation, `case` vs `grep -E` for security-sensitive validation (newline bypass), opt-out flag cross-cutting sweep, substring-match traps, HEREDOC quoting discipline, target-user resolution, idempotency-respects-flags, post-install session-restart requirement. Each pattern has bad/good examples + provenance. (2026-04-22, [#59](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/59))

- **Changed** `agents/AGENT_bugbot.md` §9 — slimmed from inline pattern list to a quick-index pointing at `SHELL_INSTALLERS.md` for details. Reduces duplication between drill-side and author-side references; single source of truth going forward. (2026-04-22, [#59](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/59))

- **Changed** `tools/README.md` "Adding New Tools" — slimmed to a 6-item contributor muscle-memory list + pointer to `SHELL_INSTALLERS.md`. Replaced inline template with an annotated skeleton. (2026-04-22, [#59](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/59))

- **Added** `skills/deployment/references/CONTAINER_DNS_NSS.md` + `commands/bugbot-loop.md` dual-signal enumeration + `skills/wrap/SKILL.md` per-file teardown evaluation — compound PR from a consuming project's sprint-auto dogfood learnings. DNS-NSS reference captures the hostname=domain/`getaddrinfo`-loopback trap; bugbot-loop Phase 1 now mandates `/reviews` + `/comments` dual-signal output with staleness rule for persistent inline comments; wrap step 5 adds a 4-class per-file evaluation for worktree teardown refusals (forgotten commit / missing gitignore / stale ephemera / container-as-root permission residue). (2026-04-21, [#58](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/58))

- **Fixed** `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh` IPAM override — reset pinned subnet + per-service `ipv4_address` entries when the parent compose file pins them, avoiding worktree-vs-primary subnet collisions. (2026-04-21, [#57](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/57))

- **Fixed** `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh` sed delimiter collision in SALT|HMAC sentinel generation — sed address pattern used a delimiter that could collide with sentinel content; switched to a safer delimiter. (2026-04-21, [#56](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/56))

- **Added** `tools/install-gcloud-cli.sh` — apt-based Google Cloud CLI installer for Debian/Ubuntu. System-wide install via Google's official apt repo with dearmored keyring (no deprecated `apt-key`). `--check` / `--with-components` flags. (2026-04-21, [#55](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/55))

- **Fixed** `skills/sprint-auto/assets/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh.wrapper` template — aborted silently when executed outside a git repo; now errors early with a clear message. (2026-04-21, [#54](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/54))

- **Added** `tools/install-oh-my-posh.sh` — user-scope prompt theme installer (no sudo). Curated 10-theme interactive menu, marker-bounded `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc` / pwsh wiring, `--theme NAME` for non-interactive CI. (2026-04-21, [#53](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/53))

- **Removed** 8 skill-duplicate command wrappers — consolidated after skill discovery shipped; thin wrapper commands that only forwarded to already-discoverable skills were redundant. (2026-04-21, [#51](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/51))

- **Changed** CHANGELOG promotion — PR #49 entries moved from `## Unreleased` into the `## 2026-04` dated section, demonstrating the self-mode `/wrap` flow. (2026-04-21, [#50](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/50))

- **Added** `/wrap` skill — post-merge documentation + cleanup sweep. Flips IDEA frontmatter to `complete`, re-sorts the ideas index, appends a devlog entry, tears down worktree stacks, scans project docs for stale references. Sits between `/work`'s merge and `/compound`'s learning-routing. Self-mode on mind-vault (this repo) skips IDEA steps, runs docs-scan against this CHANGELOG + READMEs. (2026-04-20, [#49](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/49))

- **Added** `AGENT_bugbot` pass + `skills/django/references/TESTING.md` — three compound learnings from a consuming project's PR. (2026-04-20, [#49](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/49))

- **Changed** `/bugbot-loop` retry cadence: exponential 180 → 600 → 1200s replaced with **linear 270s** — each wake stays inside the 300s prompt-cache TTL; the only backstop is `max_idle_polls = 20`. (2026-04-20, [#49](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/49))

- **Added** `/sprint-auto` skill + canonical `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh` + wrapper/hooks templates — overnight unattended orchestrator that runs a curated list of opt-in IDEAs through `/plan` → `/work` → PR creation in per-IDEA git worktrees with independent docker-compose stacks. Belt-and-suspenders opt-in (`auto_safe: true` frontmatter + explicit arg allowlist); never merges; worktrees preserved after each run. (2026-04-20, [#48](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/48))

- **Changed** `tools/bugbot.sh` canonicalised — merged variants into a single script and added the `BUGBOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL` marker to `find_bugbot_comments.sh` so `/bugbot-loop` can fast-hand-back on clean reviews without waiting out the idle-poll bound. (2026-04-20, [#47](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/47))

- **Added** `RULE_ideas-location-status` — IDEA files live in exactly two places: `docs/ideas/IDEA-NNN-<slug>.md` while `status: idea`, `docs/archive/YYYY-MM-idea-NNN-<slug>/` thereafter. Single `git mv` at `/plan` time; all subsequent status transitions are frontmatter-only. (2026-04-20, [#46](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/46))

- **Changed** top-level `README.md` restructured — sprint workflow moved to the top, mermaid loop added, sections grouped by Sprint / Cross-project / Meta. (2026-04-20, [#45](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/45))

- **Added** Sprint workflow Phase 2: `/ideate` skill (divergent-scan + adversarial filter above `/idea`) and `AGENT_curator` sprint-end promotion sweep mode (scans `docs/solutions/` for recurring patterns, proposes `/compound --promote` invocations). (2026-04-20, [#44](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/44))

- **Added** `skills/skill-writer/` emitted-templates portability rule — when a skill pattern supports multiple source-file locations, never hardcode relative paths in emitted templates; compute them from the source's directory at emit time. (Compounded from PR #42 F1.) (2026-04-20, [#43](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/43))

- **Added** Sprint workflow Phase 1: five-stage CE-inspired loop `/idea` → `/plan` (alias `/brainstorm`) → `/work` → `/bugbot-loop` → `/compound`, plus `/ingest-backlog` brownfield-takeover helper. `docs/guides/SPRINT_WORKFLOW.md` becomes authoritative for the IDEA frontmatter schema. (2026-04-19, [#42](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/42))

- **Added** `skills/django/` django-tenants parallel-test patterns — pytest-xdist + schema pooling for tenant-aware test runs. (2026-04-18, [#41](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/41))

- **Changed** Cross-host mind-vault revamp — consolidated skills/agents/setup-scripts/docs structure that the rolling config library has run on since. (2026-04-18, [#40](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/40))

## 2026-01-26 to 2026-04-17 — pre-revamp (superseded by PR #40)

This period's work is **not detailed below per-PR** because the structural revamp in [#40](https://github.com/infohata/mind-vault/pull/40) consolidated and replaced what came before. The current skills/agents/rules/commands/tools/docs layout started at #40; PRs #1–#39 shipped against an earlier layout that no longer exists.

Thematic coverage (for audit trail — see `git log` + `gh pr list --state merged --base main` for per-PR detail):

- **2026-01** (PRs #1–#13 + 7 pre-PR direct commits): initial repo structure; git-safety rule; agent roles (researcher / architect / frontend / test-engineer / curator / devops / documentation); first Django skill batch (architecture, multi-tenant, Celery, async/websocket); django-frontend (HTMX/Alpine/Bulma); deployment skill baseline; bugbot command ecosystem; screen-session deployment mandate; rule-consolidation pass; project-agnostic agent rewrite; git-safety hardening against PR-prompt-hack attempts; Docker safety check in branch cleanup.
- **2026-02** (PRs #14–#21): Ubuntu server setup script; Cursor 2.4+ integration + subagent discovery; deployment documentation tracking pattern; static/SCSS alignment with a consuming project + frontend docs; Django i18n bulk-fill msgstr pattern; cross-project skill/agent updates, artefact plans, formset patterns.
- **2026-03** (PRs #22–#35): Cursor user-level symlink setup (`~/.cursor/`); i18n-workflow rule; a consuming project's devlog pattern extraction; double-submit prevention pattern (`data-sync-submit`); query-string-generation + strict-type-hinting rules for django; generic-agents refactor; skill-description refactor pass. **Caveat**: several March PRs (#22↔#26, #13↔#29, #14↔#30, #16↔#28, #17/18/19↔#27, #20↔#31) are duplicate re-merges from a different host/branch during cross-host reconciliation; the distinct-content count is ≈7 PRs across the month, not 14.
- **2026-04 (pre-revamp)** (PRs #36–#39): vanilla-JS asymmetric deletion hazards + locale-testing rule; bounded-autonomy `bugbot-loop` policy (Option B+); `BUGBOT_CLEAN_SIGNAL` detection for fast hand-back; `RULE_git-safety` merge-direction clarification.

This section is an **acknowledgement that history exists**, not a specification of what currently ships. For the currently-shipping config, read from `## 2026-04` upward.

## How this gets maintained

`/wrap` run on mind-vault itself (self-mode) maintains this file end-to-end — Step 4 of the skill both adds new entries for the just-merged PR and promotes any existing `## Unreleased` bullets into the current `## YYYY-MM` section, so `Unreleased` is empty (or lists truly open-and-unmerged PRs) after every wrap. No human promotion step required.

For out-of-band manual entries (doc updates landed without a wrap run): prepend under **Unreleased** before merge. The next wrap run will promote them automatically.

Git log remains the source of truth; this file is the curated, human-readable summary.

**Version-header invariant**: the topmost `## v…` heading must be the full intended release version (`vMAJOR.MINOR` or `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`), never a bare `## v5` milestone banner. `make release` extracts the tag from the first such heading below `## Unreleased` (it requires a `MAJOR.MINOR` dot, so a bare banner is skipped, but don't rely on that — keep the newest header fully-qualified). `make test-release` enforces this against the live file.
