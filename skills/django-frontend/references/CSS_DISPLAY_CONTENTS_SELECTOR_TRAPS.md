# CSS `display: contents` doesn't make children selector-transparent

**When this fires**: you wrap a group of flex / grid children in an intermediate `<div id="…">` so an HTMX `outerHTML` swap can replace them as one atomic unit, and you set the wrapper to `display: contents` so the flex / grid layout still treats the children as direct items of the outer container. Then your existing `.parent > .child` rules silently stop matching half the children.

The trap is the gap between two CSS subsystems: `display: contents` affects the **box tree** (which is what layout uses) but does NOT affect the **DOM tree** (which is what selectors evaluate against). They disagree, and selectors silently lose.

## The shape

The pre-wrapper structure:

```html
<div class="snap-container">              <!-- flex parent -->
  <div class="pane-wrapper-A">…</div>     <!-- direct flex child -->
  <section class="center-pane">…</section> <!-- direct flex child -->
  <div class="pane-wrapper-B">…</div>     <!-- direct flex child -->
</div>
```

```scss
.snap-container > .pane-wrapper-A,
.snap-container > .center-pane,
.snap-container > .pane-wrapper-B {
    flex: 0 0 100%;
    scroll-snap-align: start;
}
```

You decide to wrap two of those children in a swap-target `<div>` for HTMX:

```html
<div class="snap-container">
  <div id="hot-swap-target">              <!-- NEW intermediate; display: contents -->
    <div class="pane-wrapper-A">…</div>
    <section class="center-pane">…</section>
  </div>
  <div class="pane-wrapper-B">…</div>
</div>
```

```scss
.snap-container > #hot-swap-target {
    display: contents;
}
```

**What happens**:

- **Box tree** (layout): `display: contents` removes `#hot-swap-target`'s own box. Its children become flex items of `.snap-container` for layout purposes. Flex / grid / scroll-snap behaviour continues working as before. So far so good.
- **DOM tree** (selectors): the intermediate `<div>` is fully present. The selector `.snap-container > .pane-wrapper-A` no longer matches — `.pane-wrapper-A`'s parent is now `#hot-swap-target`, not `.snap-container`. The original SCSS rules silently no-op for the wrapped children.

Symptom shape: `pane-wrapper-B` (the unwrapped sibling) keeps its `flex: 0 0 100%` + `scroll-snap-align: start`. `pane-wrapper-A` and `center-pane` lose theirs — they collapse to intrinsic width, scroll-snap stops engaging on them, swipes feel "broken" or "stuck" because only one snap target is properly sized.

## The fix — symmetric widening, across every breakpoint

Widen every affected selector to also match through the intermediate:

```scss
.snap-container > .pane-wrapper-A,
.snap-container > .center-pane,
.snap-container > .pane-wrapper-B,
.snap-container > #hot-swap-target > .pane-wrapper-A,
.snap-container > #hot-swap-target > .center-pane {
    flex: 0 0 100%;
    scroll-snap-align: start;
}
```

The original direct-child selectors stay (so `pane-wrapper-B` and any future direct-child variants still match). The widened branch adds the through-the-intermediate path for the wrapped children.

## The asymmetric-fix anti-pattern (the actual bug surface)

The bug typically lands NOT when the wrapper is introduced and the developer forgets to widen anything, but when **only some breakpoints get the widening** while others are missed.

The canonical shape:

1. Wrapper insertion ships in commit N. The desktop selector block gets widened in the same commit (it's the breakpoint the developer is testing in).
2. The mobile / tablet `@media` block in a sibling section of the SCSS file is **missed** — its selectors still only list direct-child variants.
3. Tests pass (no SCSS test layer; render-and-assert lives at the HTML level).
4. The widened breakpoint works fine. The missed breakpoint silently breaks for any user on that viewport.
5. Symptom appears unrelated to the wrapper introduction. Initial diagnosis chases a JavaScript bug (visible side effect on the missed breakpoint, often a drawer/snap-container that "wedges"). A JS band-aid recovers the user-visible symptom by full-reloading the page. The actual CSS-selector-miss stays invisible for the entire PR cycle.
6. Months later, when the JS band-aid is investigated for retirement, the missed-breakpoint selector is the load-bearing finding.

**Cost**: a JS band-aid that fires `window.location.reload()` on every state change (destroying every UX continuity guarantee the application makes), plus a multi-cycle follow-up investigation. All from one SCSS rule block missed during a structural insertion.

**Lesson**: when you insert a `display: contents` intermediate, audit **every** breakpoint's selectors that match the wrapped children — not just the breakpoint you happen to be testing in. Grep for the affected class names across the full SCSS tree:

```bash
grep -rn '<wrapped-class-a>\|<wrapped-class-b>' web/<app>/static/<app>/scss/
```

For each hit, check whether the selector path includes a route through the new intermediate. If not, widen it.

## Related selector-vs-box-tree mismatches

The same gap surfaces for any CSS feature that operates on the box tree:

- **`display: contents` and parent-state selectors**: `.parent:has(> .child)` doesn't match a child that lives one level deeper through a `display: contents` intermediate. The `:has()` selector still uses DOM hierarchy.
- **`display: contents` and `:nth-child`**: indexing is over the DOM siblings, not the effective flex siblings. A child that's index 1 in the intermediate is NOT index 1 of the outer container even though layout treats it as one.
- **CSS Counters / `counter-increment`**: counts up the DOM tree, not the box tree.

When in doubt: `display: contents` makes children **layout-transparent**, not **selector-transparent**. Anything CSS does at selector-evaluation time still sees the full DOM.

## When NOT to introduce the `display: contents` intermediate

If the layout doesn't require the children to be siblings of the outer container (i.e. you don't need flex / grid / scroll-snap to see them as direct items), don't use `display: contents` — wrap them in a normal block-level intermediate that has its own selector path you can target intentionally. The selector-vs-layout split only matters when layout DEMANDS sibling-of-parent semantics. For HTMX swap-target wrapping around content that doesn't participate in a flex / grid / scroll-snap parent, plain `display: block` (or `contents` only if the parent layout needs it) is the right default.

## Detection

Add to the structural-change checklist for any commit that introduces or moves a `display: contents` intermediate:

- [ ] List every CSS selector that previously matched the wrapped children's parent path.
- [ ] For each, decide: does the rule still apply through the new intermediate? If yes, widen. If no, leave unchanged.
- [ ] Walk EVERY breakpoint that has its own selector block. Mobile-specific media queries are the most common miss site (they're often last to be updated because they're at the bottom of the file).
- [ ] If the project has a CSS audit tool (stylelint, postcss-purify), run it on the affected breakpoints.
