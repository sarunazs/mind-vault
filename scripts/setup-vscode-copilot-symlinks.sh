# Setup VS Code GitHub Copilot symlinks to mind-vault (best-effort).
#
# Copilot's file conventions:
#   prompts       -> ~/.config/Code/User/prompts/<name>.prompt.md
#   instructions  -> ~/.config/Code/User/instructions/<name>.instructions.md
#   chat modes    -> ~/.config/Code/User/chatmodes/<name>.chatmode.md
#
# ⚠️  Format caveats:
#   - Copilot expects .prompt.md / .instructions.md extensions (this script handles the rename).
#   - Copilot frontmatter schema (mode: ask|edit|agent, model:, tools:) differs from mind-vault's
#     (agent: general/test-engineer, etc.). Files will be discovered but frontmatter-specific
#     features (mode selection, model pinning) will not activate.
#   - Copilot has no native skill or subagent equivalent — skills/ and agents/ are NOT linked.
#
# For full Copilot fidelity, author .prompt.md files natively. This script exists to get
# mind-vault's command body text surfaced in VS Code Copilot chat at zero extra maintenance cost.
