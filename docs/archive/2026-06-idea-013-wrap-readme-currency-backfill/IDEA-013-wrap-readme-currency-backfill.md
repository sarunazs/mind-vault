# IDEA-013: Amend /wrap docs pass to audit + backfill the project's main README

**Status**: ✅ Complete (2026-06-03)
**Priority**: Medium

**Problem** (or opportunity): `/wrap`'s Step 6 (downstream docs scan) only greps the main README for the **current IDEA's** changed identifiers (deleted symbols, renamed models, new make-targets). It never audits the README as a **whole** against current reality. So the main README accumulates silent drift across many IDEAs — version-highlight framing goes stale (mind-vault's README still frames "v4 highlights" at v4.6), skill/command/agent counts fall behind, feature/capability tables miss newer skills, and stability flags (e.g. the sprint-auto ⚠️) outlive their cause — because **no single IDEA's wrap is responsible for whole-README currency**. Step 4 already solves exactly this shape for CHANGELOG/devlog via **backfill-gap detection** (list recently-merged PRs, cross-reference against entries, backfill ≤3 / surface larger gaps); the README has no equivalent.

**Evidence**: mind-vault's own README is dated despite IDEA-012 having just updated its claude/review-loop bits — the *other* sections (version highlights, counts, feature tables) had drifted unnoticed.

**Proposal** (or idea): Amend `/wrap`'s docs pass (extend Step 6, or a dedicated sub-step / `references/` doc) with a **main-README currency + backfill** check that audits the whole README — not just the IDEA's touched identifiers — against current reality. Candidate audit probes:

- **Version/highlight framing** vs the actual top CHANGELOG version (the `## v<N>` Step-4b already detects) — e.g. "v4 highlights" → "v4.6".
- **Counts** (skills / commands / agents / engines) vs the filesystem (`ls skills/*/SKILL.md | wc -l`, etc.).
- **Feature / capability tables** completeness vs shipped skills (a skill exists but isn't in the README's table).
- **Stale stability / ⚠️ flags** whose cause has since resolved.
- **Quick-start / command surface** vs the current commands + slash-invocable skills.

Disposition mirrors Step 6's patch-now-vs-follow-up + Step 4's backfill-gap rule: small mechanical drift (counts, version string, a missing table row) → fix in this wrap; large prose rewrite → surface as a follow-up (human-reviewed, never auto-rewritten).

**Why now**:
- mind-vault's README is the live dated example — the **dogfood / first backfill** lands in the same work.
- The capability surface is growing fast (a third review engine just shipped); the drift rate is increasing.

**Non-goals**:
- **Not** auto-rewriting architectural prose / high-level narrative — the existing Step 6 rule (human-review for architectural docs) stands; this audit flags + applies mechanical count/version/table fixes only.
- **Not** a separate `/readme-audit` command — it's a `/wrap` docs-pass enhancement, gated by cadence so it doesn't bloat every single-file wrap.
- **Not** a generated/templated README — it stays hand-authored; the check keeps the hand-authored file *honest*, it doesn't own it.

**Folded-in finding (2026-06-03) — headline workflow-ordering drift.** A whole-docs audit (the exact audit this IDEA proposes to automate) surfaced a concrete README-currency bug worth fixing in the same work: the **headline depictions** of the sprint loop showed `work → /review-loop → /wrap → /compound` — review *before* the doc wrap — which contradicts the wrap-before-review discipline the skill bodies already enforce (`skills/wrap/references/WRAP_BEFORE_REVIEW.md`, `wrap/SKILL.md`, `review-loop/SKILL.md`, `sprint-auto`). Because every sprint IDEA is doc-heavy (IDEA file + plan + devlog), the two-pass `review (deliverables) → /wrap → review (docs)` is the *canonical* path, not an exception — but the README/SPRINT_WORKFLOW mermaid diagrams (single review node, wrap absent) and the README/ONBOARDING glyphs presented the legacy single-pass order, leading agents to sequence review before wrap. **Resolution folded into this IDEA's implementation** (per the user, 2026-06-03): promote the two-pass to canonical across the headline surfaces — both mermaid diagrams now render `work → review (deliverables) → wrap → review (docs) → compound`; the README/ONBOARDING glyphs, the SPRINT_WORKFLOW stages table (4a/4b/4c), and the `WRAP_BEFORE_REVIEW.md` "default chain" framing are aligned to match. This is the first dogfood of the README-currency audit: the audit found the drift, the fix ships in the same branch. The generic /wrap-step automation (cadence, checklist scope) remains the open design fork below.

**Open questions** (for `/plan`):
- **Cadence** — run the whole-README audit on *every* wrap (too heavy for a one-file IDEA), only on **doc-heavy** wraps, only when **Step 4b version-bump fired**, or on a **staleness threshold** (e.g. README untouched for N merges)? Lean toward "version-bump wraps + doc-heavy wraps," but resolve in plan.
- Where it lives — inline Step 6 checklist additions vs a dedicated `skills/wrap/references/README_CURRENCY.md` loaded on demand (per the references-first promotion principle).
- How to make the counts project-agnostic (mind-vault counts skills/agents; another project counts apps/endpoints) — a small per-project hint, or purely heuristic.
