# Sprint Workflow

Mind-vault's five-stage development loop, inspired by Every Inc's compound-engineering plugin but deliberately tuned for a single-user, cross-project knowledge store.

    C -.next sprint.-> I1
```

Each run of the loop produces durable artifacts in the target project's `docs/` tree. The loop compounds because the final stage — `/compound` — routes learnings back into mind-vault when they generalise, extending skills, rules, and reviewer personas every project thereafter will pick up.

The optional `/ideate` stage sits above `/idea` — use it between sprints to discover candidate improvements via divergent scan + adversarial filter, then promote the survivors into IDEA files (it uses the same schema as `/idea`).

## Philosophy

- **Each unit of engineering work should make the next unit easier.** Traditional development accumulates debt; the compound loop inverts it.
- **Stage skipping is a first-class affordance.** Trivial fixes bypass `/idea` and `/plan` entirely. The loop is a pipeline, not a bureaucracy.
- **Artifacts live in the target project.** Mind-vault is the library; projects are the journal. Mind-vault grows only when `/compound` explicitly promotes a cross-cutting pattern.
- **Review stage is engine-agnostic.** Projects opt into `/review-loop <PR> bugbot` (Cursor Bugbot), `/review-loop <PR> copilot` (GitHub Copilot), `/review-loop <PR> claude` (Claude Code Review — the `claude-code-action@v1` + `code-review` plugin, push-triggered/comment-anchored), or any subset e.g. `/review-loop <PR> bugbot,copilot,claude` — same phase structure, same hard bounds. `/compound` reads any engine's findings file as an input source and routes each cleared finding.

## The five stages (plus optional discovery)

| Stage                       | Command                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Input                                    | Output                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 4a.

| 4b. Review — single pass    | `/review-loop <PR> bugbot` (Cursor Bugbot), `/review-loop <PR> copilot` (GitHub Copilot), `/review-loop <PR> claude` (Claude Code Review), or any subset, per project config; curator-only fallback if no external bot | Wrapped PR                               | Cleared findings (code + docs together) + loop output file.

**Brainstorm folds into plan.** `/brainstorm` is an alias for `/plan`. When the IDEA file is thin or the description is under-specified, the plan skill interactively explores requirements (the brainstorm front-end) before emitting the plan artifact.

## Overnight unattended mode — `/sprint-auto`

`/sprint-auto` is an optional wrapper around the **full sprint workflow** (stages 2–5) for unattended overnight execution on a VPS. Per IDEA it drives `/plan → /work → /wrap (idea-only, pre-merge) → review-loop (single pass over the wrapped PR) → escalation`; at batch end the integration phase merges + tears down, then it runs `/compound` per candidate and the review-loop on each mind-vault PR produced. The review-loop carries `bugbot`, `copilot`, `claude`, or any subset per project config (`SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE`), or is skipped when engine is `none` (curator-only fallback). T2/T3 review findings resolve autonomously via rollback-able fresh commits; per-pass attempt caps are 20 (per-IDEA review) / 5 (mind-vault compound), each an independent `/review-loop` session (budget spans all configured engines). The skill runs each IDEA in its own git worktree (code-surface only — no per-IDEA stack; a single shared integration docker stack at port offset `+30000` handles all verification), and stops at the HITL merge boundary per `RULE_git-safety`.

Opt-in is belt-and-suspenders: every IDEA needs `auto_safe: true` + `auto_safe_reason` in frontmatter **and** explicit presence in the invocation args. Never scan-mode. IDEAs touching sensitive paths (`.env*`, base `docker-compose.yml`, CI workflows, destructive migrations, auth middleware) require `sensitive_paths_cleared: true`. Priority is queue order only (scheduling preference), not a safety dimension — `auto_safe: true` is the authoritative signal. See `skills/sprint-auto/references/safety-gates.md` for the full gate list.

Worktrees are preserved after each run — success or failure — so the human can review PRs or diagnose failures in the morning. Per-IDEA worktrees are code-surface only, so there is no per-IDEA stack to tear down (state S8 is a no-op); the single integration docker stack has its containers stopped (`docker compose down`, never `-v`) at S11.13, volumes + worktree filesystems retained for inspection. The skill never runs `git worktree remove`, never merges, never force-pushes. The post-merge cleanup (`-v` + worktree remove) is the human's `/land --integration <batch-iso>` chore after merge. See `skills/sprint-auto/SKILL.md` for the full pattern, `references/post-pr-sequence.md` for the S0–S15 state machine, `references/escalation-policy.md` for the rollback + attempt-cap contract, and `references/worktree-lifecycle.md` for the project-local bootstrap-script contract (`tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh`).

## Compound routing (the novel piece)

When you've just solved a problem — or a PR-review finding has been cleared — `/compound` classifies the learning through a hybrid narrative-probe + taxonomy-quiz and writes it to the right destination:

| Shape of learning                                     | Destination                                                       | Example                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Project-specific fix with domain detail               | `<project>/docs/solutions/<topic>.md`                             | Webhook HMAC mismatch due to flat-payload edge case                              |
| Cross-project pattern                                 | mind-vault skill or `references/` file                            | "Async tenant context loss in Channels → wrap in `with tenant_context(tenant):`" |
| Guardrail-worthy hard rule (always-on, cross-cutting) | `mind-vault/rules/RULE_<name>.md`                                 | "Never push to main" / "Renames first, drops last"                               |
| Reviewer-caught pattern                               | new pass appended to `agents/AGENT_<persona>.md`                  | "Dictionary key collisions silently swallow overrides"                           |
| Tool-worthy repeatable action                         | `mind-vault/commands/<verb>.md` or `tools/<script>.sh`            | Regex sweep for `format_html(_(...))` migration drift                            |
| User-behavioural preference                           | auto-memory `feedback_*` / `project_*` / `user_*` / `reference_*` | "Prefer bundled PR over split for this kind of refactor"                         |

Mind-vault destinations land as commits on the active sprint branch (no new branch if one is in flight — no branch spam), with an open PR maintained by `/compound` itself. If mind-vault is on `main`, the skill creates a fresh `compound/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>` branch first. `RULE_git-safety` is honoured: the agent never commits to `main`, never force-merges; the human merges the PR.

## Authoritative schemas

These are the canonical frontmatter shapes. Phase 1.5 `/ingest-backlog` and Phase 2 `/ideate` both read this section as the source of truth.

### IDEA file frontmatter

```yaml
---
id: 112
title: Split IDEAS.md into per-idea files
status: idea          # idea | in-progress | complete | superseded
priority: medium      # high | medium | low
supersedes: []        # list of IDEA ids this replaces
superseded_by: null   # scalar id of the replacement, or null
depends_on: []        # list of IDEA ids required before starting
related: []           # list of IDEA ids that share context
created: 2026-04-14   # YYYY-MM-DD
completed: null       # YYYY-MM-DD or null
---

# IDEA-112: Split IDEAS.md into per-idea files

**Problem**: <short paragraph>

**Proposal**: <short paragraph or bullets>

**Why now** / **Non-goals** / **Related** — free-form prose follows.
```

Deliberately small so it maps 1:1 onto a future structured data model without field-name drift.

### Plan and solution frontmatter (stage handoff)

```yaml
---
stage: plan | solution
slug: short-kebab-slug
created: 2026-04-19   # YYYY-MM-DD
source: <path-to-IDEA-file or null>
status: draft | ready | shipped
project: <project-name>
---
```

The `source` field is what makes handoff possible: `/plan` reads an IDEA file and sets `source:` to its path; `/compound` reads a plan or PR-review output and traces back through `source:` chains when documenting the learning.

## Directory layout inside a target project

Per [`IDEAS_LOCATION_STATUS`](../../skills/idea/references/IDEAS_LOCATION_STATUS.md) (formerly `RULE_ideas-location-status`, moved to `skills/idea/references/` per PR #106's always-on-tier criterion), an IDEA file lives in exactly one of two locations across its whole life — `docs/ideas/` while in backlog, `docs/archive/YYYY-MM-idea-NNN-<slug>/` everything after. The only filesystem move is `idea → archive` at `/plan` time (or `/work` time for small-scope plans that bypassed `/plan`). Post-move, status flips are frontmatter-only.

```text

```

- `docs/ideas/README.md` is the single index for all statuses. Entries link out to `../archive/<dir>/` when the IDEA has left backlog. Completed ideas appear as footer lines under "References — Implemented".
- The archive directory's name (`YYYY-MM-idea-NNN-<slug>/`) is stamped at move-time and never changes — neither completion nor rejection renames it. Stable reference path for the idea's whole life.
- `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` follows a per-month file convention under `docs/archive/` (one file per calendar month).
- Solutions use dated or topic slugs so they sort and never collide.

## Running the loop

Typical invocation on a new feature:

```bash
/idea                      # creates IDEA-NNN-<slug>.md interactively
/plan <slug>               # or /brainstorm <slug> — produces plan doc
/work <plan-path>          # dispatches to personas, commits as it goes
# ... open PR ...
/wrap                      # 4a finalize docs (pre-merge, --scope=docs default)
/review-loop <pr-url> <engine>    # 4b single review over the wrapped PR — bugbot | copilot | claude | any subset
/land <NNN>                # 4c merge (non-protected) + teardown; protected → hands back PR URL
/compound                  # routes what we learned
```

Stage skipping on a trivial fix:

```bash
# no /idea, no /plan — just go
git checkout -b fix/typo
# ... fix ...
# open PR, /review-loop <PR> <engine> (bugbot, copilot, or claude) clears it, maybe /compound if you learned something

## Right-sizing

| Work shape                    | Minimum ceremony                                               |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Typo / one-liner              | skip idea + plan; do work + review                             |
| Small bounded fix (\< 30 min) | skip idea; plan is optional                                    |
| Feature with unknowns         | full loop from idea                                            |
| Cross-cutting refactor        | full loop; compound at end is non-optional                     |
| Post-incident learning        | stages 1–3 already done elsewhere; invoke `/compound` directly |

The loop's value scales with the work's ambiguity. Don't force ceremony onto work that doesn't need it.
