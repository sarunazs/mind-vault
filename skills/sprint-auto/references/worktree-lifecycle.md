# sprint-auto — worktree lifecycle

**v3.2 architecture (current)**: sprint-auto runs **one** docker stack per batch — the integration worktree's, at port offset `+30000`. Per-IDEA worktrees are pure code surfaces (no `.env`, no docker compose). All verification — per-IDEA targeted tests, per-IDEA review fix-cycles, integration union, full suite, integration review — routes to the integration worktree's stack via the `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE` env var. See [`integration-stage.md`](integration-stage.md) for the full integration-worktree contract.

**v1 architecture (deprecated)**: every per-IDEA worktree had its own docker stack with a per-IDEA port offset (`10000 + (idea_number % 100) * 100`). Hardware-infeasible at scale — the user explicitly redirected v3 plan toward the single-stack model because running N+1 stacks per batch was impossible on the available hardware.

The bootstrap script itself supports both modes:

- **v1 mode**: invoked as `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh <slug> <idea_number>` — the legacy formula derives the offset from the idea_number. Caps at `+19900`.
- **v3.1 mode**: invoked as `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh integration-runner 0 --port-offset 30000` — explicit offset; the idea_number is a placeholder. This is what S(-1) in the v3.1 state machine uses.

The `--port-offset` flag enforces a safety ceiling at `+39851` (max remapped port `9300+39851 = 49151`, the registered-port boundary).

The skill calls into a project-local `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh`, which is a **thin wrapper** around the canonical script that lives in mind-vault. The wrapper + canonical split gives the same benefit as symlinking (updates to mind-vault propagate to every project) without the symlink's biggest failure mode: when mind-vault isn't at the expected path (fresh VPS, CI runner, different user), a symlink gives a cryptic "file not found"; a wrapper prints an actionable error with remediation steps.

The 80% of bootstrap logic that's identical across Docker projects lives in the canonical script. The 20% that's genuinely project-specific (MinIO bucket setup, custom migrations, ES index creation, smoke test URL) lives in an optional project-local `tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh` that the canonical script sources.

## Layout

```text

  tools/
    sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh          ← canonical implementation (lives here)
  skills/sprint-auto/
    assets/
      sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh.wrapper  ← template; projects copy → tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh
      sprint-auto-hooks.sh.example      ← template; projects copy → tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh (optional)

  tools/
    sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh          ← thin wrapper, committed to project, ~30 LOC
    sprint-auto-hooks.sh              ← optional project-specific hooks
```

## Setup — one-time per project

```bash
# From the project's primary checkout
cp ~/projects/mind-vault/skills/sprint-auto/assets/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh.wrapper \
   tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh
chmod +x tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh
git add tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh
git commit -m "chore: wrapper for mind-vault sprint-auto-bootstrap"

# Optional: if the project needs post-up init (MinIO, migrations, seed fixtures) or a
# custom smoke test, copy the hooks template and edit:
cp ~/projects/mind-vault/skills/sprint-auto/assets/sprint-auto-hooks.sh.example \
   tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh
chmod +x tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh
# Edit tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh for project specifics, then:
git add tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh
git commit -m "chore: sprint-auto hooks for <project> (migrations + MinIO + smoke)"
```

**Also add to `.gitignore`** (canonical bootstrap emits this file on every run; header says "do not commit" but each project needs its own gitignore line):

```
# Worktree-local docker compose override emitted by tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh
docker-compose.override.yml
```

Without this line, every `/sprint-auto` cycle leaves an untracked `docker-compose.override.yml` in the worktree that blocks `git worktree remove` at teardown time unless force-flagged — which (per `/land`'s teardown, [`WORKTREE_TEARDOWN.md`](../../land/references/WORKTREE_TEARDOWN.md)) hides real findings. It's an adoption-checklist item when onboarding a project to sprint-auto.

## The canonical script's responsibilities

Project-agnostic, runs in every Docker Compose project:

1. **Preflight**: docker present, jq present, `.env.template` exists, `.env` and `docker-compose.override.yml` absent (refuses to clobber).
2. **Sentinel `.env`**: copies `.env.template`, regex-replaces credential-shaped keys (`*_KEY`, `*_SECRET`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_PASSWORD`, `*_PASS`, `*_PWD`, `*_CREDENTIAL`) with `test-not-a-real-key`; generates fresh random `SECRET_KEY` and `*_SALT` / `*_HMAC`; neutralises `user:pass@host` patterns in `*_URL` values.
3. **Port-offset override**: runs `docker compose config --format json` to discover every service with host-port bindings, emits `docker-compose.override.yml` with `ports: !override` blocks shifted by `10000 + (idea_number % 100) * 100`.
4. **Stack up**: `docker compose up -d --wait`, tailing failure output into the auto-run log on exit 1.
5. **Hooks**: if `tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh` exists, sources it and calls `post_up_init` + `smoke_test` (if declared).
6. **Default smoke**: services-configured count must equal services-running count via `docker compose ps`.

All of this is one script, reused across every project.

## The wrapper's responsibilities

~30 LOC, lives in each project, committed to the project's repo. Signature:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Locate the canonical script; exec into it with args.
set -euo pipefail
CANON_REL="tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh"
candidates=(
  "${MIND_VAULT_ROOT:-}"
  "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)/../mind-vault"
  "$HOME/projects/mind-vault"
  "$HOME/.local/share/mind-vault"
  "/opt/mind-vault"
)
# find first $candidate/$CANON_REL that's executable, else print an actionable error
# full template: skills/sprint-auto/assets/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh.wrapper
```

Lookup order: explicit env override → sibling dir of the project → `~/projects/mind-vault` (the user's convention) → `~/.local/share/mind-vault` → `/opt/mind-vault`. If none match, the wrapper prints the list of candidates it searched and the fix command (`git clone ... mind-vault` or `export MIND_VAULT_ROOT=...`).

**Why not just symlink?** Three concrete failure modes the wrapper catches cleanly:

- **Fresh clone on a new machine**: mind-vault not cloned yet → wrapper says "clone it here", symlink gives `ENOENT`.
- **CI runner**: mind-vault lives at a non-standard path → wrapper honours `MIND_VAULT_ROOT` env var, symlink breaks.
- **Mind-vault moved**: user reorganised `~/projects/` → wrapper checks multiple paths, symlink is now dangling.

Updates to the canonical script propagate to every project via `git pull` in mind-vault alone — same benefit as symlinks, without the fragility.

## The hooks file

Project-local. Not a symlink, not a wrapper — a real file, edited in-project. Bash functions:

```bash
# tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh

post_up_init() {
    # Runs AFTER docker compose up, before smoke test.
    # Idempotent. Return 0 on success, non-zero on failure.
    docker compose exec -T web python manage.py migrate --noinput || return 1
    # ... MinIO bucket setup, seed fixtures, ES indices, etc.
}

smoke_test() {
    # Replaces the canonical's default "all services running" check.
    # Call `default_smoke_test` at the end if you want both.
    docker compose exec -T web curl --fail -s http://localhost:8000/health/ >/dev/null
}
```

See `skills/sprint-auto/assets/sprint-auto-hooks.sh.example` for a fuller template.

**Why the hooks file is copied, not wrapped**: the content IS the project-specific part. There's nothing to delegate to a canonical version — each project's migrations, fixtures, and smoke-test URL differ. A wrapper would be a wrapper around the project's own code, which is pointless.

### `post_up_init` must build EVERY runtime artefact the test suite reads — not just migrate + seed (compounded)

A `post_up_init` that runs `migrate` + `seed` but **not the project's compiled-asset steps** leaves the integration stack subtly incomplete: tests that assert on a *built* artefact fail in the integration run though they pass locally. The recurring instance: **compiled translation catalogs** — an i18n project's `{% trans %}`/`gettext` strings fall back to the source language until `compilemessages` (or equivalent) runs, so any test asserting a *translated* string fails in a fresh worktree stack. Same class: collected static, built CSS/JS bundles, search-index population. Rule: `post_up_init` should reproduce the project's **full** "make it runnable" sequence (migrate → seed → compile-translations → collectstatic/build-assets → index), idempotently — mirror what a from-scratch `make start` does, not a subset. The tell is a green local suite + a handful of red "expected <translated/built> got <source/empty>" failures only in the integration run.

### DB `down -v` reset between IDEAs is skippable for pytest-only IDEAs with no migrations (compounded)

The per-IDEA S2-entry DB reset (`down -v` + `up` + migrate + seed, ~5 min) exists to give a main-equivalent baseline so each per-IDEA PR is independently deliverable. But its value is **nil** when (a) verification is pytest-django (which builds its *own* isolated test DB from migrations, ignoring the dev DB), (b) the IDEA ships **no migrations** (test DB builds from the existing set), and (c) Playwright/e2e — the only consumer of the dev DB — is absent or gated off. In that intersection the prior IDEA's run never mutated what the next IDEA's tests read, so the reset is pure wall-clock overhead. Keep the reset when any of those don't hold (migrations present, e2e against the live dev tenant, or a non-pytest verification path). Log the skip + the reason rather than dropping it silently.

## Worktree naming

### Per-IDEA worktrees (code-surface only in v3.1)

- **Path**: `../<project>-auto-<slug>/` — sibling of the primary checkout. `-auto-` prefix distinguishes machine-created worktrees from human-created ones for filtering in `git worktree list` and teardown scripts.
- **Branch**: `auto/<slug>`. Distinctly prefixed; a human continuing the work can rebase or rename later.
- **Both** use `<slug>` (not the IDEA number) so they read well in `git worktree list` and `gh pr list`.
- **Stack**: NONE in v3.1. The worktree contains only the checked-out source. No `.env`, no `docker-compose.override.yml`. All verification routes to the integration worktree.

### Integration worktree (v3.1 only)

- **Path**: `../<project>-auto-integration-<batch-iso>/` — sibling of the primary checkout. `-auto-integration-` prefix distinguishes from per-IDEA worktrees.
- **Branch**: `integration/sprint-auto-<batch-iso>`. NEVER `staging/...` — the existing project-level `staging` worktree (human-owned, tracks `main`) is a separate artefact sprint-auto must not touch.
- **`<batch-iso>`**: the same ISO-8601 timestamp used in `auto-run-<ISO>-summary.md`.
- **Stack**: the only stack of the batch, port offset `+30000` via `--port-offset 30000`.

## The port-offset strategy

### v3.1 — single integration stack

```bash
tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh integration-runner 0 --port-offset 30000
```

Max remapped port: `9300 + 30000 = 39300` — in registered-port range, below ephemeral range (32768-60999), defensive against ad-hoc `+10000` parallel-worktree stacks. See `IDEA_integration_branch.md` § Port-offset math for the full constraint analysis.

### v1 (legacy) — per-IDEA stacks via idea-number-derived offset

Formula: `10000 + (idea_number % 100) * 100`. Caps at `+19900`. Collisions on modulo-100 alignment. v3.1's collapse to a single integration stack sidesteps the formula's cap entirely. Retained for backward compatibility — projects not yet adopting v3.1 still use this formula.

| IDEA | offset (v1) | web (8000 →) | db (5432 →)                   |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 050  | +15000      | 23000        | 20432                         |
| 099  | +19900      | 27900        | 25332                         |
| 100  | +10000      | 18000        | 15432                         |
| 150  | +15000      | 23000        | 20432 — **collides with 050** |

A latent bug in v1: 6+ IDEAs at offsets `+10000, +20000, ..., +60000` push max remapped port (9300+60000 = 69300) past the 16-bit hard ceiling. v3.1 sidesteps it; if anyone re-introduces a multi-stack scheme later, the formula needs a bound check.

## Teardown policy

### v3.2 (current)

After the human merges the single `[INTEGRATION]` PR, one command from the primary tree — `/land --integration sprint-auto-<batch-iso>` — tears down the whole batch (see `skills/land/SKILL.md` § `--integration` mode).

**Integration worktree**: stops the stack at S11.13 (`docker compose down`, NOT `-v`; volumes preserved for inspection until teardown). `/land --integration` then removes the rest:

```bash
cd $integration_worktree
docker compose down -v
cd -
git worktree remove $integration_worktree
git branch -d integration/sprint-auto-<batch-iso>
```

**Per-IDEA worktrees**: nothing to tear down (no stack ever existed); the same `/land --integration` call removes each `auto/<slug>` worktree + branch (the per-IDEA PRs auto-closed as merged ancestors when the \[INTEGRATION\] PR merged):

```bash
git worktree remove ../<project>-auto-<slug>
git branch -d auto/<slug>
```

See [`integration-stage.md`](integration-stage.md) § "Integration teardown" and `skills/land/SKILL.md` § `--integration` mode.

### v1 (legacy)

The skill does not teardown after a run. Preserving state is the whole point of "failure is a diagnostic artefact". Cleanup one-liner per per-IDEA worktree:

```bash
cd <worktree> && docker compose down -v && cd - && git worktree remove <worktree> && git branch -D auto/<slug>
```

## Fallback when the wrapper is missing

If `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh` doesn't exist in the project at all, the `/sprint-auto` skill falls back to an inline minimal bootstrap: sentinel `.env`, naive `+10000` port offset on common service names (`web`, `db`, `redis`, `elasticsearch`, `minio`), `docker compose up`. **No post-up init** — the fallback cannot know what the project needs.

Tests that depend on fixtures, buckets, or indices will fail in `/work`'s verification, and the IDEA will be skipped. This is why the preflight warns loudly when the wrapper is missing and the scripted path is strongly preferred for overnight batches.

For v3.1, the inline fallback only applies to the integration worktree (per-IDEA worktrees never call the script). If the integration bootstrap falls back to the inline minimal mode, it uses `--port-offset 30000` semantics (offset `+10000` is the fallback's hard-coded value — collides with conventional v1 worktrees, so the fallback should be replaced with the proper script promptly).
