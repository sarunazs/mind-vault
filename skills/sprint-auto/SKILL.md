description: Unattended overnight orchestrator — runs a curated list of opt-in IDEAs through /plan → /work → review-loop (deliverables) → /wrap (idea-only) → review-loop (docs) → integration phase (sequential merge + batch wrap + tests + integration review) → /compound (mind-vault, review-looped). Review-engine selector (`SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE`) dispatches to `/bugbot-loop` (Cursor Bugbot), `/copilot-loop` (GitHub Copilot), or both concurrently; default `none` skips external review and relies on AGENT_curator. Per-IDEA PRs target the integration branch (v3.2 — integration-as-merge-gate); the [INTEGRATION] PR is the SINGLE PR that targets the parent (main / sprint-*) and is what the human reviews + merges. Eliminates forward-sync and per-PR re-review — per-IDEA PRs stay IDEA-isolated, integration PR carries the integrated state + compatibility patches as visible commits. Single integration-worktree docker stack at port offset +30000 is the only stack of the batch; per-IDEA worktrees are pure code surfaces with verification routed via SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE env var. Full DB reset between IDEAs guarantees per-IDEA PRs are independently deliverable when reviewed in isolation. Two opt-in modes: auto_safe: true (autonomous through merge gate) and auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true (autonomous through merge gate + emit a manual-evaluation checklist for the human to walk before merging — for IDEAs whose visual / a11y / interaction residue cannot be covered by render-and-assert tests). Enforces frontmatter opt-in + explicit arg allowlist; resolves T2/T3 review-loop escalations autonomously (caps 20/5/10/10/20/5 across stages, each independent, per configured engine); halts only at the HITL merge boundary per RULE_git-safety.

# sprint-auto

Autonomous wrapper around the full sprint workflow (`/plan → /work → review-loop → /wrap → review-loop → integration phase → /compound`, where `review-loop` resolves to `/bugbot-loop` and/or `/copilot-loop` per the configured engine, or is skipped when engine is `none`) for unattended overnight execution on a VPS. Takes a curated list of IDEAs that the human has pre-cleared as low-risk and runs each one through the per-IDEA loop, then runs all of them through a batch-level integration phase: a long-lived integration branch is the **base ref** for every per-IDEA PR. Per-IDEA PRs target integration; the integration phase merges them sequentially, lands compatibility / conflict-resolution patches as visible commits, validates the integrated state with union + full-suite tests + the configured review loop, and opens a single non-draft `[INTEGRATION]` PR that targets the parent (main / sprint-*). When the human merges that one PR, every per-IDEA PR auto-closes as a merged ancestor.

The skill stops at the one HITL boundary that matters: merge to a protected branch.

This skill is **not** a substitute for human review — it is a throughput multiplier for ideas where the human has already decided "no harm trying". The human still reviews. The skill's job is to close the gap between "I have 10 low-risk IDEAs in the backlog" and "I have 10 IDEA-isolated per-PR PRs (each drained through the configured review engine on deliverables + docs) plus one integration PR (drained through the same engine on the integrated state) waiting on my desk, with cross-project learnings already promoted to mind-vault as their own review-looped PRs".

**v3.2 (current) vs v3.1**: v3.1 had per-IDEA PRs target the parent (main / sprint-*), then forward-synced the integration's content back into each per-IDEA PR after S11.10. The result was N PRs all carrying the entire batch's diff — atomic-batch-merging at the cost of "N identical PRs" UX confusion. v3.2 inverts the routing: integration is the base ref, per-IDEA PRs stay IDEA-isolated for review, integration PR is the single merge gate. Forward-sync (S11.11) and per-PR re-review (S11.12) are deleted — they only existed to compensate for the v3.1 routing.

## When to use

**TRIGGER when:**

- user says "run these IDEAs overnight", "sprint-auto IDEA-NNN ...", "set claude on autopilot for these", "full auto on these ideas"
- user is setting up a VPS / screen session / background run and wants multiple IDEAs executed unattended
- a curated list of IDEAs is ready: each marked `auto_safe: true` OR `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true` in frontmatter (see [`references/safety-gates.md`](references/safety-gates.md) § Mode A / Mode B for the distinction), each with a thick enough body to survive `/plan` without thin-input bootstrap

**SKIP when:**

- any IDEA in the list lacks both `auto_safe: true` and `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true` → refuse the batch, surface the offender, ask the human to tag or drop it
- the user wants interactive development → route to `/plan` or `/work` directly
- the user wants to discover candidates → route to `/ideate`
- the user has a single IDEA and plans to supervise → just run `/plan <slug>` and `/work` manually; the ceremony isn't worth it for one

## Pattern

### 1. Preflight + integration bootstrap — gate the batch and bring up the only stack

Run once, before any per-IDEA work. If **any** check fails, abort with an actionable message; do not partially-run the batch.

1. **Primary-tree cleanliness.** `git status --porcelain` in the primary checkout must be empty. Dirty tree → abort.
2. **Branch.** Primary tree must be on `main` (or a non-protected branch the user explicitly authorised in the invocation). Never create auto worktrees off an unknown checkout state.
3. **Fetch.** `git fetch origin` so worktrees branch off the freshest `origin/main`.
4. **Docker daemon reachable.** `docker compose version` exits 0.
5. **Bootstrap script present.** Probe for `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh` in the project root (see [`references/worktree-lifecycle.md`](references/worktree-lifecycle.md)). If missing, warn and fall back to the generic recipe from `RULE_parallel-worktree-docker`; the user may prefer to add a script rather than run the generic path unattended.
6. **IDEA gate — every one.** For each arg, resolve the IDEA file (glob both `docs/ideas/` and `docs/archive/*/`) and verify the safety gates in [`references/safety-gates.md`](references/safety-gates.md). Any failure → abort the batch before starting, list the offenders. Belt-and-suspenders: (`auto_safe: true` OR `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true`) in frontmatter AND explicit arg presence, not either/or. Both opt-in modes route through the same per-IDEA loop; the only divergence is at S5 (`/wrap --scope=idea-only` Step 7 emits a manual-evaluation checklist when `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true`) and at S11.10 (the integration PR's body aggregates each emitted checklist's URL — see [`references/integration-stage.md`](references/integration-stage.md) § Per-IDEA evaluation checklists).
7. **Budget sanity.** If the caller passed `--budget-minutes=N` or `--budget-tokens=N`, record it. Per-IDEA default timeout: **300 minutes** wall clock. Per-batch default: `len(ideas) * 300` minutes plus an additional **180 minutes** for the integration phase (S11.5–S11.13).
7.5. **Review-engine resolution.** Read the project's review-engine declaration and export it as `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE`. Resolution order:
   1. Explicit `--review-engine=<value>` arg passed to sprint-auto.
   2. `review_engine:` key in `.mind-vault.yml` at the repo root.
   3. `review_engine:` key in the project's `CLAUDE.md` frontmatter (if present).
   4. Fallback: `none` (curator-only).
   Accepted values: `bugbot`, `copilot`, `bugbot,copilot` (or list form `[bugbot, copilot]` in YAML — coerce to CSV at export time), `none`. Any other value → abort with an actionable error. Export `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE=<resolved-csv-or-none>` so downstream stages can dispatch. Log the resolution explicitly: `review_engine: <value> (source: <arg|.mind-vault.yml|CLAUDE.md|default>)`.
8. **Integration bootstrap (S(-1)).** This is the **only** docker stack the batch will use **and** the integration branch is published immediately so per-IDEA PRs in S2 can target it:
   ```bash
   batch_iso=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%SZ)
   git worktree add "../<project>-auto-integration-${batch_iso}" \
       -b "integration/sprint-auto-${batch_iso}" origin/main
   cd "../<project>-auto-integration-${batch_iso}"
   git push -u origin "integration/sprint-auto-${batch_iso}"   # v3.2: publish before S2
   tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh integration-runner 0 --port-offset 30000
   export SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE="$PWD"
   export SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_BRANCH="integration/sprint-auto-${batch_iso}"
   ```
   The `tools/sprint-auto-bootstrap.sh` invocation creates `.env` from the template (sentinel-replaced credentials), emits the docker-compose override at the explicit `--port-offset 30000` (the legacy idea-number-derived formula caps at `+19900`, so the explicit flag is required), brings up the stack, runs project-local `post_up_init` if defined. Failure of the worktree+push or the bootstrap = abort the batch (no per-IDEA work proceeds; record `integration_outcome: bootstrap_failed`). See [`references/integration-stage.md`](references/integration-stage.md) for full mechanics.

   **Why push at S(-1)** (v3.2 change from v3.1, where push happened at S11.10): per-IDEA `/work` invocations in S2 open PRs with `--base $SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_BRANCH`. GitHub requires the base ref to exist on `origin` at PR-creation time, so the integration branch must be pushed first. The push is just the branch ref — no PR is opened until S11.10.

9. **Playwright availability probe (non-fatal).** After the integration stack is up, probe whether Playwright is installed in the `web` service. The probe outcome flips the IDEA-level `requires_playwright` gate; it is **never** a batch-level abort.
   ```bash
   if docker compose exec -T web playwright --version >/dev/null 2>&1; then
       export SPRINT_AUTO_PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE=1
   else
       export SPRINT_AUTO_PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE=0
       echo "[preflight] Playwright not installed in integration stack." \
            "IDEAs with 'requires_playwright: true' will gate to manual-eval-only mode" \
            "(plan author writes manual-eval-checklist rows; Playwright tests are deferred)." \
            "Run tools/setup_playwright.sh and rebuild the image to enable." | tee -a "$BATCH_LOG"
   fi
   ```
   Persist `SPRINT_AUTO_PLAYWRIGHT_AVAILABLE` to the batch state file so per-IDEA `/plan` and `/work` invocations read the same value across worktree boundaries (env vars don't survive subshells). The IDEA-level gate (`requires_playwright` frontmatter flag) is described in [`references/safety-gates.md`](references/safety-gates.md) § Playwright-availability gate. Three branches:
   - **Probe = present, IDEA has `requires_playwright: true`** → plan author writes Playwright tests; eval-checklist pre-fills covered rows from the plan's `playwright_test_coverage` block.
   - **Probe = absent, IDEA has `requires_playwright: true`** → plan author writes ONLY the manual-eval-checklist rows for Playwright-relevant scenarios; the frontmatter flag stays as a backref so a later "set up Playwright" IDEA can backfill tests.
   - **IDEA has no `requires_playwright`** → IDEA proceeds independent of probe outcome.

   Bootstrap circularity is solved by manual-eval fallback: the first project-side "set up Playwright" IDEA's `requires_playwright` is `false` (it provisions the gate's "present" state but doesn't depend on it); after it merges, downstream IDEAs' probes flip to "present" and the gate begins authoring tests. No IDEA is ever blocked on infra readiness.

### 2. Per-IDEA execution loop (S0–S11)

For each IDEA in the list, in argument order, sequentially. The full state machine is in [`references/post-pr-sequence.md`](references/post-pr-sequence.md). Each step heading below tags the state it covers.

**Canonical failure-path invariant** (applies throughout this loop): every failure path re-enters the happy path at **step 9 (harvest)**, then flows through **step 10 (log) → step 11 (next IDEA)**. **Step 8 (per-IDEA teardown) is a no-op in v3.1** — there is no per-IDEA stack to tear down.

1. **Worktree bootstrap — code-surface only (S0).** Per-IDEA worktrees in v3.1 are pure code surfaces. NO `.env`, NO `docker compose up`, NO post-up init.
   ```bash
   git worktree add "../<project>-auto-<slug>" -b "auto/<slug>" origin/main
   cd "../<project>-auto-<slug>"
   ```
   That's the entire bootstrap. The agent edits files here, commits, pushes; tests and verification run elsewhere (the integration worktree, via the env var). If the worktree-add itself fails, re-enter at step 9 with `outcome: bootstrap_failed`.

   Append a start entry to `docs/archive/<dir>/auto-run-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (see [`assets/auto-run-log-template.md`](assets/auto-run-log-template.md)).

2. **Plan the idea (S1).** Invoke the `plan` skill against the IDEA slug. Because step 6 of [`references/safety-gates.md`](references/safety-gates.md) guaranteed the IDEA body is thick, the thin-input bootstrap will skip and planning runs non-interactively. Architect-review pass runs; if `REJECTED`, re-enter at step 9 with `outcome: plan_rejected`. If `REQUIRES ABSTRACTION`, the plan author already incorporated findings — proceed.

3. **Reset DB on integration worktree (entry to S2).** Before invoking `/work`, sprint-auto resets the integration worktree's DB to a main-equivalent baseline. This is what makes per-PR PRs **independently deliverable**: each IDEA's tests run against a DB equivalent to what the morning reviewer's `main` will look like before they merge it.
   ```bash
   cd "$SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE"
   docker compose down -v
   docker compose up -d --wait
   # post_up_init from tools/sprint-auto-hooks.sh: migrate, seed, etc.
   ```
   Reset wall-clock: ~5 min depending on seed size.

4. **Work the plan (S2).** Invoke the `work` skill against the emitted plan. The work skill detects `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE` is set and routes its verification step there — see [`references/integration-stage.md`](references/integration-stage.md) and [`../work/SKILL.md`](../work/SKILL.md). Per `RULE_git-safety`, the per-IDEA worktree is on `auto/<slug>` (not main), so commits flow freely. `/work` dispatches personas, commits per plan item, runs verification on the integration worktree (`git fetch origin auto/<slug>` + `git checkout --detach origin/auto/<slug>` there + `docker compose up -d --force-recreate web celery` + targeted tests; **`--detach` is required** because the per-IDEA worktree already has `auto/<slug>` checked out, and git refuses cross-worktree branch checkouts), and opens the PR on success.

   **v3.2 PR base routing**: when `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_BRANCH` is set, `/work` passes `--base "$SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_BRANCH"` to `gh pr create` instead of the parent (`main` / `sprint-*`). The PR's diff is naturally IDEA-isolated against integration (which starts as a copy of `origin/main` at S(-1) and only accumulates merge commits as later IDEAs land). Each per-IDEA PR remains independently reviewable for the morning reviewer. If verification fails or `/work` returns without opening a PR, re-enter at step 9 with `outcome: verification_failed`.

   **Playwright defence-in-depth at S2**: if the IDEA's plan contains a `playwright_test_coverage` block (i.e. the plan author wrote Playwright tests), `/work`'s verification step re-probes `docker compose exec -T web playwright --version` against the integration stack. If the probe now fails (infra was uninstalled between S(-1) and now, or the image was rebuilt without Playwright), S2 logs `playwright_unavailable: true` to the auto-run log, skips the Playwright tests for that IDEA only, and continues with non-Playwright tests. The IDEA still ships; the manual-eval rows the plan would have pre-filled stay un-pre-filled. The integration PR's body surfaces this in S11.10's per-IDEA evaluation summary.

5. **Review-loop the PR — deliverables pass (S3).** Invoke the configured review loop(s) (`/bugbot-loop` / `/copilot-loop` per `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE`) on the PR `/work` just opened. With `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE` set, each loop's Phase 0 skips entirely — per-IDEA worktrees never get `.env` or docker. Fix-verification routes to the integration worktree as in step 4 (no DB reset within the review session — fix commits don't typically migrate; reset cost would explode). Three outcomes (per [`references/escalation-policy.md`](references/escalation-policy.md)):
   - **Clean** → step 6.
   - **Hand-back with Tier 2/3 findings** → step 5a (escalation).
   - **Review-loop budget exhausted** → step 6 with `deliverables_review_outcome: budget_exceeded`.

   **5a. Escalation resolution — deliverables pass (S4).** Tier 2 auto-approved (pre-authorized by `auto_safe` frontmatter + explicit-arg allowlist), Tier 3 attempted (not handed back). Maximum thinking effort per attempt. Each attempt is a **fresh commit**; if it needs a different angle, `git revert <previous-attempt-sha>` before trying again. Cap: **20 attempt cycles**. Verification routes to integration worktree per step 4. Return to step 5 after each attempt.

6. **/wrap (pre-merge, idea-only scope) — S5.** Invoke `/wrap --scope=idea-only <NNN>` — narrows wrap to the IDEA-local subset:
   - IDEA frontmatter flip (`status: in-progress` → `status: complete` + `completed: <today>`)
   - Downstream docs scan (per IDEA's own touched paths)

   **Skipped at this stage** (deferred to batch wrap on integration branch at S11.7):
   - DEVELOPMENT_LOG entry append
   - ideas-index move

   This eliminates the structural N-way line-conflict that every parallel `/wrap` produces today (every IDEA appending to the same lines of `docs/archive/YYYY-MM-DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` and `docs/ideas/README.md` → guaranteed conflicts at merge time). See [`../wrap/SKILL.md`](../wrap/SKILL.md) for the `--scope=idea-only` mode.

7. **Review-loop the PR — docs pass (S6).** Invoke the configured review loop(s) again, on the PR with the docs commit(s) on top. Same Phase-0-skip rule. Three outcomes as in step 5.
   - **Clean** → step 9 (skip step 8; no per-IDEA stack to tear down).
   - **Hand-back with Tier 2/3 findings** → step 7a (docs escalation).
   - **Review-loop budget exhausted** → step 9 with `docs_review_outcome: budget_exceeded`.

   **7a. Escalation resolution — docs pass (S7).** Same contract as step 5a, **cap of 5 cycles**. Independent budget from S4. After cap, ship-non-clean for docs and proceed to step 9.

8. **Per-IDEA teardown — N/A in v3.1 (S8).** Was: `docker compose down` on per-IDEA stack. In v3.1, no per-IDEA stack exists. The integration worktree's stack stays up for the next IDEA's S2 reset. Step kept in the doc as a no-op marker for backward-compat with v1's state numbers; the auto-run log records `docker_teardown: skipped_v3_no_per_idea_stack`.

9. **Capture per-IDEA compound candidates (S9).** Harvest learnings from the IDEA's run — review findings (from either pass) that exposed patterns, escalation attempts that revealed new recipes, infrastructure gaps discovered during bootstrap, downstream-docs drift patterns from step 6's sweep. Do **not** invoke `/compound` yet — queue candidates into a per-batch list for consolidation at step 12. On failure paths, harvest still runs but may queue fewer candidates — plan-rejection patterns and verification-failure patterns are themselves valuable compound signals.

10. **Finalise the per-IDEA auto-run log (S10).** Fields written (see [`assets/auto-run-log-template.md`](assets/auto-run-log-template.md)). Always written, including failure paths. Commit + push to `auto/<slug>`; the log rides into the PR.

11. **Move to next IDEA (S11).** The per-IDEA worktree stays on disk (still useful for code-surface inspection if needed). The integration worktree's stack stays up. The next IDEA's step 3 will reset DB and start fresh.

### 3. Integration phase (S11.5–S11.13) — batch validation

After all per-IDEA loops complete, the integration phase runs once. Full mechanics in [`references/integration-stage.md`](references/integration-stage.md); summary here:

1. **Final pre-merge DB reset (S11.5).** `cd $SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE && docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d --wait && migrate + seed`. Same baseline as per-IDEA resets but for the integration test run.

2. **Sequential merge (S11.6).** `git checkout integration/sprint-auto-<batch-iso>`. For each `auto/<slug>` in batch-arg order: `git merge --no-ff auto/<slug>`. On conflict: resolve on integration branch using [`references/integration-conflict-resolutions.md`](references/integration-conflict-resolutions.md), commit the resolution. Continue. Track which branches needed resolution.

3. **Batch wrap on integration branch (S11.7).** Compose ONE devlog commit + ONE ideas-index commit covering all N IDEAs. This is the work that per-IDEA `/wrap --scope=idea-only` (step 6) deferred. Eliminates the N-way wrap-stage conflicts at the source. **Also maintain the Decisions Recap section** at the top of `docs/ideas/README.md` if the cohort is large (~10+ IDEAs sharing context) — see [`../wrap/SKILL.md`](../wrap/SKILL.md) § "Decisions Recap section". Each IDEA's wrap row + any newly-locked cross-cutting decision is rolled into the same batch-wrap commit.

4. **Integration tests — union (S11.8).** Read each merged-in IDEA's plan-doc Verification section, union test paths, run pytest on the integration stack. Migrate up if migrations were merged. Failure → fix on integration branch, cap **10 attempts**.

5. **Full test suite (S11.9).** Sprint-end gate. Full pytest on the integrated state. Same fix discipline, cap **10 attempts**.

6. **Review-loop on integration branch via `[INTEGRATION]` PR — the merge gate (S11.10).** Review bots are PR-anchored (both Cursor Bugbot and GitHub Copilot operate on PRs, not branches), so:
   ```bash
   gh pr create --base main --head integration/sprint-auto-<batch-iso> \
       --title "[INTEGRATION] sprint-auto-<batch-iso>" \
       --body "Integration of $N per-IDEA PRs (links below). Merging this PR ships
   the entire batch. Per-IDEA PRs auto-close as merged ancestors."
   ```
   The PR is **non-draft** (v3.2 change from v3.1 — it's the actual merge gate, not a validation harness). Then run the configured review loop(s) against the PR's number. **Cap 20 attempts per engine** — integration branches are elephants (N-times-larger review surface than any per-PR PR; T2/T3 findings have proportionally longer tails). Symmetric with the S4 deliverables-pass cap because integration is deliverables-class review of the integrated state, not docs-class.

7. **Integration teardown (S11.13 — was S11.13 in v3.1; S11.11 + S11.12 are deleted in v3.2).** `docker compose down` (NOT `down -v`; volumes preserved for inspection). Worktree filesystem stays. **The `[INTEGRATION]` PR is left OPEN — it's the merge gate, not auto-closed.** The integration branch + worktree are cleaned up by the human's post-merge `/wrap` of the **integration PR** (not per-IDEA), which extends `/wrap` to detect the integration-PR-merge case and `git branch -d integration/sprint-auto-<batch-iso>` + `git worktree remove` the integration worktree.

**v3.2 — what's deleted vs v3.1**:
- ~~S11.11 forward-sync~~ **deleted**: per-IDEA PRs don't need the integrated state propagated back, because their reviewer reviews them at their natural IDEA-isolated diff against integration. The integrated state lives on integration, reviewed via the [INTEGRATION] PR.
- ~~S11.12 per-PR re-review~~ **deleted**: per-IDEA PRs haven't had any commits added since S5 (`/wrap --scope=idea-only`), so the review's S6 docs-pass already covered the current head. Re-running adds zero signal at non-trivial cost.
- ~~"atomic-batch merging" forward-sync property~~ **superseded**: in v3.2 the integration PR is itself atomic-batch — merging it ships every per-IDEA at once. Same property, different mechanism.

**Failure mode summary** (full table in [`references/integration-stage.md`](references/integration-stage.md)):
- S(-1) bootstrap fails (worktree create OR integration-branch push OR docker bootstrap) → abort batch; no per-IDEA work proceeds
- S11.6 merge resolution fails → log + continue to next branch in sequence
- S11.8/S11.9 tests cap-exceeded → ship integration-non-clean (flagged in summary)
- S11.10 review cap-exceeded → ship integration-non-clean (flagged); PR still left open as merge gate

### 4. Batch-level compound + mind-vault review-loop (S12–S15)

When the integration phase completes (clean or with flags):

1. **Consolidate compound candidates (S12 prep)** harvested from every per-IDEA step 9. Cross-IDEA patterns get de-duplicated here: if three IDEAs independently surfaced the same review finding category, it's a stronger compound candidate than any single instance.

2. **Invoke `/compound` per candidate — autonomous mode (S12).** The compound skill's Shape-C narrative probe normally asks up to three questions before routing; under sprint-auto those answers come from the compound candidate's own metadata. The user's invocation of `/sprint-auto` is the *transitive* confirmation that compound's "Never silently promote to mind-vault" interaction rule requires.

3. **Each mind-vault PR → its own review-loop session (S13 + S14).** Once `/compound` produces a PR on `compound/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>` in the mind-vault repo, invoke the configured review loop(s) on the mind-vault PR with the same escalation policy as steps 5a/7a. Cap **5 attempt cycles per engine** (single-pass — mind-vault compound PRs are documentation by nature).

4. **Write `docs/archive/auto-run-<ISO-timestamp>-summary.md` (S15 artefact)** in the primary tree. See [`assets/auto-run-log-template.md`](assets/auto-run-log-template.md). Includes a new **Integration check** section listing the integration phase's outcomes (merge results, test results, review-loop results per engine, forward-sync results, re-review results) and a **Compound section** listing each mind-vault PR and its review outcome.

5. **Print the summary block to stdout (S15):**

   ```text

6. **Worktree preservation discipline.** Containers on the integration stack are stopped at S11.13. Per-IDEA worktree filesystems stay (code-surface only; never had stacks). The integration worktree filesystem stays. Full teardown of the integration worktree is the human's chore via `/wrap NNN` post-merge for the last-of-batch IDEA.

### 5. Post-merge reminders (still human) — v3.2 model

The batch's merge surface is **one PR** — the `[INTEGRATION]` PR (S11.10). Merging it lands every per-IDEA `auto/<slug>` in one shot via the merge commits already on integration. GitHub auto-closes each per-IDEA PR as a merged ancestor (their head SHAs are reachable from the merged integration commit). Everything except the destructive worktree+branch teardown already ran during the batch:
- Per-IDEA frontmatter flip + downstream docs scan: S5 (`/wrap --scope=idea-only`)
- Devlog batch entry + ideas-index batch update: S11.7 (single commit on integration)

The post-merge `/wrap` invocation runs only the destructive teardown. With v3.2's integration-as-merge-gate, the natural shape is **one** `/wrap` call against the integration ref:

```markdown
## Next steps (post-merge of the [INTEGRATION] PR)

Run `/wrap --integration sprint-auto-<batch-iso>` from the primary tree —
it auto-detects post-merge mode and runs:
- For each per-IDEA `auto/<slug>` from the batch manifest:
  - `git worktree remove ../<project>-auto-<slug>`
  - `git branch -d auto/<slug>`
- For the integration worktree:
  - `cd $integration_worktree && docker compose down -v` (drops volumes)
  - `git worktree remove $integration_worktree`
  - `git branch -d integration/sprint-auto-<batch-iso>`

If you merged any per-IDEA PR independently (atypical — splits the
batch), run `/wrap NNN` per IDEA you merged, then `/wrap --integration`
for the residual integration cleanup.

The frontmatter flip + downstream docs scan already landed at S5; the
devlog batch entry + ideas-index batch update already landed at S11.7
on the integration branch and merged to parent via the integration PR.
```

No `/compound` reminder here — compound ran in section 4 above.

## Interaction rules

- **Belt-and-suspenders opt-in.** Frontmatter declares one of two modes — `auto_safe: true` (autonomous-through-merge-gate) OR `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true` (autonomous-through-merge-gate + eval-checklist emission for the human to walk before merging) — AND the IDEA's slug appears in the explicit arg allowlist. Never scan-mode in v1; curation is the whole point. The two modes are orthogonal opt-in signals — see [`references/safety-gates.md`](references/safety-gates.md) § Mode A / Mode B for the authoring contract.
- **Eval-gate is the unblock for UX-overhaul / a11y / interaction-heavy IDEAs.** When an IDEA's *implementation* is mechanical (component scaffolding + JS API + render-and-assert tests) but ships behaviour that needs human eyes on visual / focus / screen-reader / animation residue, opt-in via `auto_safe_with_eval_gate: true` instead of leaving the IDEA out of sprint-auto entirely. Sprint-auto runs the IDEA end-to-end without pausing; `/wrap` S5 emits a structured checklist to the IDEA's archive dir (see [`../wrap/SKILL.md`](../wrap/SKILL.md) § Step 7); S11.10 aggregates every emitted checklist's URL into the integration PR's body. The morning reviewer's existing PR-merge gate is now also the manual-walk gate — same review surface, structured in.
- **No merges, ever.** The skill stops at PR creation (project PRs, the `[INTEGRATION]` draft PR, and mind-vault compound PRs). `gh pr merge`, `git push` to protected branches, anything that crosses the HITL gate — forbidden. The `[INTEGRATION]` draft PR specifically is **closed without merging** at S11.13.
- **Single docker stack contract.** v3.1 brings up exactly ONE docker stack per batch — the integration worktree's, at port offset `+30000`. Per-IDEA worktrees are pure code surfaces (no `.env`, no `docker compose up`). The verification routing via `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE` env var is what makes this work; if any per-IDEA worktree somehow ends up with a `.env` or running stack, treat it as a defect.
- **Verification-routing env var.** Sprint-auto exports `SPRINT_AUTO_INTEGRATION_WORKTREE=<path>` at S(-1). `/work`, the configured review loop(s) (`/bugbot-loop` / `/copilot-loop`), and any test-runner shelled out from the per-IDEA loop must honor this var and route their docker/test commands to that path. See [`references/integration-stage.md`](references/integration-stage.md) for the contract.
- **DB reset cadence: per-IDEA, NOT per-review-commit.** A single reset at the entry to each IDEA's S2 (~5 min) gives main-equivalent baseline. Resets within a review session would multiply wall-clock 10× without quality gain — fix commits don't typically migrate.
- **Rollback-able commits only for escalation resolution.** During step-5a, step-7a, S11.8/S11.9 fix attempts, S11.10 review escalation, and S11.12 re-review, the skill MAY commit multiple attempts, each revertable via `git revert`. It MAY NOT force-push, rewrite history, or amend commits produced by `/work` or by `/wrap`'s docs sweep — those are part of the PR's review history. If a fix attempt goes wrong, the correct move is `git revert <bad-sha>` + a fresh attempt commit.
- **Two-pass review-loop per IDEA + integration review.** Every successful-through-PR IDEA run receives **two** per-PR review-loop invocations (deliverables S3, docs S6); the batch gets one integration-state review (S11.10). Each has its own independent escalation budget — 20 deliverables / 5 docs per IDEA, plus 20 integration. When `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE` lists both engines, each pass invokes both loops sequentially under the same budget contract — i.e. 20 deliverables means "20 cycles per engine on the deliverables pass," not "20 cycles total across engines." Skipping any of these passes is never correct on the happy path. (v3.2 deletes v3.1's per-PR re-review S11.12 — the per-IDEA PR's head doesn't change after S6, so re-running adds no signal.)
- **Review-engine selector — project-configurable, default `none`. Supports one or both engines concurrently.** Sprint-auto's S3 / S6 / S11.10 / S13 / S14 review-loop passes are dispatched via `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE` (exported during preflight from the project's `review_engine` declaration in `CLAUDE.md` or `.mind-vault.yml`):
    - `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE=bugbot` → invoke `/bugbot-loop` (Cursor Bugbot) at every pass.
    - `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE=copilot` → invoke `/copilot-loop` (GitHub Copilot) at every pass.
    - `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE=bugbot,copilot` (or list form `review_engine: [bugbot, copilot]` in YAML) → invoke **both** loops sequentially at each pass. Order is fixed: bugbot first (typical 1–10 min review), then copilot (typical ~30 s). Each loop's escalation budget is independent — caps apply per engine per pass. Findings from one engine don't preempt the other; a "clean" verdict requires both engines to clear.
    - `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE=none` (default) → **skip the external review pass entirely**. Auto-run log records `review_pass: skipped (engine=none)` for the pass; the per-IDEA PR's `AGENT_curator` pre-commit pass is the only review gate. Surface the skip prominently in the morning summary so the human reviewer knows external-bot coverage was not in play. Treat curator-only as a weaker gate — known to miss edge cases the external bots catch. Wherever this skill describes invoking "the review loop" or `/bugbot-loop`, read it as "invoke each engine's loop sequentially per the resolved `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE`, or skip when engine is `none`".
- **Review-loop invocations are MANDATORY (when an engine is configured); ship-non-clean is a fallback, not an upfront opt-out.** When `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE` is not `none`, the skill's S3, S6, and S11.10 contracts are "invoke each configured engine's loop (`/bugbot-loop` / `/copilot-loop`), work the escalation cycle, ship-non-clean only after the per-pass per-engine cap is reached." They are NOT "decide upfront not to invoke and call it ship-non-clean." The auto-run log must record the attempt outcome for each pass per engine, NOT `deferred to morning review` — the latter is a tell that no attempt was made. (When `SPRINT_AUTO_REVIEW_ENGINE=none`, the pass is logged as `review_pass: skipped (engine=none)` per the selector rule.)
- **Sequential in v1.** Parallel IDEA execution invites host contention, and v3.1's single-stack architecture inherently serialises through the integration worktree's DB. Add concurrency later only if v3.1 calibration shows headroom.
- **Respect the architect.** If the plan-time architect review comes back `REJECTED`, that IDEA is done for this batch. Trust the review.
- **Non-clean review is OK to ship-for-review — *after* the attempt was made.** After the per-pass per-engine cap is hit OR the review-loop returned an exhaust-budget signal, an IDEA with unresolved Tier 2/3 findings still produces a valid PR. The morning reviewer decides. Do not block the pipeline on perfection; transparency in the auto-run log (attempt SHAs, approaches, outcomes, per-engine outcomes when both are configured) is the contract.
- **Compound transitive confirmation.** `/compound`'s "Never silently promote to mind-vault" rule is satisfied by sprint-auto's own invocation: the user launched sprint-auto knowing compound runs at end-of-batch, and every mind-vault PR produced lands in the summary for review.
- **Abort-the-batch triggers**: docker daemon lost, disk full, the bootstrap script exits with a class of error flagged unrecoverable, token/minute budget blown at batch scope, mind-vault repo becomes unreachable during section 4. **NEW in v3.1**: integration worktree bootstrap (S(-1)) failure is a hard abort — without the integration stack, no verification can run.
- **Priority is queue order, not a safety gate.** `priority: high` / `medium` / `low` affects the order in which the human schedules ideas — it does not imply "how dangerous to automate". `auto_safe: true` is the authoritative safety signal.
- **`[INTEGRATION]` PR is THE merge gate — non-draft, human-merged.** S11.10 opens it as a non-draft PR targeting parent (`main` / `sprint-*`). S11.13 leaves it OPEN (no auto-close). The human reviews the integration PR's combined diff (per-IDEA diffs + compatibility / conflict-resolution patches as visible commits) and merges it. Per-IDEA PRs auto-close as merged ancestors. (v3.2 change from v3.1, which had the integration PR as `--draft` and auto-closed at S11.13.) Treat any code path that would `gh pr close` the integration PR before human merge as a defect.
- **Per-IDEA PRs target integration, NOT parent — keeps each PR's diff IDEA-isolated.** Reviewer inspects per-IDEA PRs at their natural single-IDEA scope (against the integration base, which starts as a copy of `origin/main`). The integrated state lives on the integration PR; the morning reviewer reads the review-loop findings on both surfaces — IDEA-isolated findings on per-IDEA PRs, integration-state findings on the integration PR. The merge is a single click on the integration PR. *(v3.2 redesign — superseded v3.1's "forward-sync gives the reviewer atomic-batch merging" model. v3.1's mechanism: forward-sync the integrated state into every per-IDEA PR, so any single merge shipped the batch. v3.2's mechanism: integration is the base ref + the merge gate; the property drops out for free without "N identical PRs" UX confusion. Compounded 2026-05-01 from a sprint/ux-overhaul batch where the reviewer noted "now we have 3 identical PRs", confirming v3.1's forward-sync trade-off was reviewer-hostile in the morning-review surface.)*

## When NOT to use these patterns

- **Single IDEA with supervision available.** Use `/plan` + `/work` directly — less ceremony.
- **Any IDEA without `auto_safe: true`.** Tag it first via `/idea <slug>` update, with an explicit `auto_safe_reason` in frontmatter explaining why the human cleared it.
- **IDEAs touching sensitive paths.** See [`references/safety-gates.md`](references/safety-gates.md) for the default-deny list. Override only via explicit `sensitive_paths_cleared: true` in the IDEA frontmatter.
- **First run on a new project under v3.1 mechanics.** First run signals are listed in `IDEA_integration_branch.md` § First-batch monitoring. Run any sprint-auto batch as if it's a real batch — there are no low-stakes nights — but pay extra attention to the listed signals.
