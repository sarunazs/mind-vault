# Find Claude Code Review activity on a PR — synthesizes the engine-adapter
# contract markers from the `claude-code-action@v1` running the `code-review`
# plugin via the `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` workflow.
# Used by the /review-loop skill (mind-vault) as well as human inspection.
#
# ⚠️ TRAP — action + `code-review` plugin ≠ Anthropic's MANAGED Code Review App.
# We run `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` (OAuth/subscription-billed) on a
# self-hosted workflow, NOT the managed "Claude Code Review" GitHub App. The
# managed App posts a dedicated `Claude Code Review` CHECK-RUN with severity
# JSON; the action posts NOTHING of the sort. So unlike copilot/bugbot, claude
# has NO pollable named check-run — the only RUNNING/DONE surface is the
# GitHub *Actions* job status of the `claude-code-review` workflow run. Anything
# you read at code.claude.com/docs about machine-readable check-runs describes
# the managed App and DOES NOT APPLY here. See engine-claude.md § Identity.
#
# ── Divergences from find_copilot_comments.sh (architect findings A2/A3/A6/A8) ──
#
# A7/R2 — STATE FROM THE ACTIONS JOB, not a check-run. CLAUDE_CHECKRUN is
#   SYNTHESIZED from `gh api .../actions/workflows/claude-code-review.yml/runs`
#   filtered to the head SHA, picking the LATEST run by `run_started_at` (dedup:
#   the `synchronize` auto-run and any `@claude review once` fallback collapse to
#   one authoritative signal). queued/in_progress → RUNNING; completed → DONE.
#   The Actions CONCLUSION is GREEN whether claude found 0 or 5 issues — it is a
#   RUNNING/DONE signal only, NEVER a verdict.
#
# A6 / LAYER-2 — CLEAN REQUIRES A POSITIVE POSTED SIGNAL, never zero-inline alone.
#   A claude run can report `success` having posted NOTHING (action issue #1087 — the
#   buffered-comment result-capture grabs a TodoWrite response instead of the review),
#   which is indistinguishable from a genuinely-clean run by run status. So "completed
#   + zero inline" is a FALSE-CLEAN vector, NOT a clean signal. clean iff claude POSTED
#   a clean summary (case-insensitive substring "no issues found"; substring not full
#   sentence per the copilot two-phrasing lesson, find_copilot_comments.sh:182-189)
#   AND zero inline findings. The fixed workflow (assets/claude-code-review.yml —
#   classify_inline_comments:false + claude_args + a prompt forcing a posted summary
#   even when clean) is what makes a genuinely-clean run POST that summary.
#
# A3 / LAYER-2 — RACE + SILENT GUARD (load-bearing). A `completed` run with NO readable
#   verdict (no posted findings AND no clean summary) is held as STATUS=in_progress
#   (RUNNING) so the orchestrator's "DONE + zero findings = CLEAN" can't fire on it.
#   CONCLUSION is never consulted (claude concludes `success` regardless of findings).
#   The settle window (CLAUDE_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS, default 180) only picks the marker:
#   within → CLAUDE_REVIEW_PENDING (comments may still land); elapsed → CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT
#   (didn't → NOT clean: #1087 / read-only perms / un-fixed workflow; re-trigger or verify,
#   never auto-clean). Settle age in Python `datetime` (cross-platform), never `date -d`.
#
# A8 — CONSERVATIVE BOTH-AND IDENTITY FILTER. claude's comment author login is
#   UNCONFIRMED until the dogfood — the filter requires BOTH (a) the comment author
#   login matching a claude-action identity AND (b) the code-review plugin's
#   comment-body signature, NEVER either alone, so an over-loose filter fails toward
#   "no clean detected" (keeps polling — safe), never a false CLEAN. See # CALIBRATE
#   markers below for the exact login + body signature to lock on the first run.
#
# A2 — REACHABILITY PROBE. This script reports whether the action is installed by
#   probing `gh api .../actions/workflows` for `claude-code-review.yml`. If absent it
#   emits CLAUDE_NOT_INSTALLED=true and exits 0 so the orchestrator's default
#   resolution can self-exclude claude (degrade loudly) rather than hang to HUNG.

# ==============================================================================
# CALIBRATED — dogfood step 9 on PR #167 (claude-code-action run 26834423838,
# 2026-06-02, model claude-sonnet-4-6). Confirmed against the live run log:
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# IDENTITY (Q1) — CONFIRMED `github-actions[bot]`. The action posts inline
#   comments via the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN` (log: post-buffered-inline-comments.ts
#   with GITHUB_TOKEN env), so the author login is the shared `github-actions[bot]`,
#   NOT a `claude[bot]` app identity. (Extra app-style logins kept as harmless
#   future-proofing in case the action switches to an app token.)
#
# POSTING MODEL — the BARE (read-only / un-fixed) action posts only buffered inline
#   comments and NO summary, AND can drop even those (#1087). The PR-#167 dogfood run
#   logged "No buffered inline comments" and was READ as clean via the old zero-inline
#   arm — but that was only safe because the run genuinely had nothing AND we later
#   learned (LAYER 2) it could equally have been a silent #1087 drop. ⚠️ SUPERSEDED:
#   the zero-inline arm is NO LONGER a clean signal (see the A6/LAYER-2 header). The
#   FIXED workflow (assets/) forces a posted clean summary, so:
#     • CLEAN = a POSTED clean summary ("no issues found") + zero inline.
#     • success + nothing posted after settle = CLAUDE_REVIEW_SILENT (NOT clean).
#
# INLINE FILTER — CALIBRATION REFINES A8. A8 prescribed BOTH-AND (login AND body
#   signature) to stop a loose login from over-claiming. But for INLINE review
#   comments that asymmetry is DANGEROUS: a body-signature that doesn't match
#   claude's real comment body would filter a genuine finding OUT → zero-inline →
#   FALSE CLEAN (the one direction we must never fail). On this repo, NOTHING ELSE
#   posts inline *review* comments as `github-actions[bot]` (inline review comments
#   are review output by construction), so login-membership ALONE is both correct
#   and the safe direction for inline (errs toward over-counting → keep polling,
#   never a false clean). Inline detection is therefore LOGIN-ONLY. If a second
#   bot ever posts inline review comments via the Actions token, reintroduce a
#   body-signature AND-clause here.
#
# SUMMARY FILTER — keeps BOTH-AND (login AND body signature). The action posts no
#   summary today, but IF one ever appears, a stray `github-actions[bot]` issue
#   comment containing "no issues" must NOT be mistaken for a claude clean signal
#   — so summary clean-detection still requires the body signature. (Here the
#   false-positive direction is the dangerous one, so BOTH-AND is correct.)
#
# CLEAN SUBSTRING (A6) — now THE clean signal (LAYER 2): with the fixed workflow a
#   genuinely-clean run posts a summary containing it. Wording NOW CONFIRMED downstream
#   (see the SUMMARY CALIBRATION block below): the clean family is "no issues found" /
#   "no bugs found" — matched by CLAUDE_CLEAN_PATTERNS, not a single literal.
#
# STILL UNCALIBRATED (no finding observed yet — this run was clean):
#   • CLAUDE_BODY_SIGNATURES exact wording (only matters for the summary arm now).
#   • Whether inline findings share a pull_request_review_id (Q1) — anchor keys on
#     comment id either way, so safe; confirm when claude first posts a finding
#     (step 10 tri-engine on a rougher diff, or a deliberate probe).
# ==============================================================================
# Single source of truth — exported once, read by every python pass via env.
#
# ── SUMMARY CALIBRATION — CONFIRMED on a downstream PR (2026-06-03, the first
#    high-volume findings-bearing claude review observed in the wild — 13 summary
#    bodies). This SUPERSEDES several PR-#167 guesses with real data; see
#    engine-claude.md § calibration update — findings live in the SUMMARY BODY. ──
#  • SUMMARY LOGIN = `claude[bot]` (NOT `github-actions[bot]` — that login is the
#    PR-size bot). The action posts its review SUMMARY as a `claude[bot]` ISSUE
#    comment; inline comments (when any) come via GITHUB_TOKEN as github-actions[bot].
#    Both logins stay in the set so either surface is recognized.
#  • SUMMARY HEADING = literal `## Code review`. The old signature `code-review`
#    (hyphen) did NOT match "Code review" (space) → claude's whole summary was
#    UNRECOGNIZED → its body findings were invisible (the C1 gap). Fixed: `code[ -]?review`.
#  • CLEAN IS WHOLE-REVIEW, NOT SUBSTRING-ANYWHERE. claude clears sections
#    independently: a review can say "Bugs: No issues found." in one section AND list
#    "Docstrings missing" / "violations" in another. A bare `'no issues found' in body`
#    test FALSE-CLEANS that mixed review. Clean now requires a positive clean phrase
#    AND the ABSENCE of any finding marker (CLAUDE_FINDING_MARKERS).
#  • CLEAN PHRASING VARIES — "No issues found." AND "No bugs found." both seen on the
#    genuinely-clean final verdict. Match the family, not one literal.
#  • NO-OP BODIES ("Skipped — draft", "Skipped — already posted review") match the
#    signature but are NOT verdicts. CLAUDE_NOOP_PATTERNS filters them out before
#    a verdict is read (else a draft/duplicate no-op masquerades as a real summary).

# Finding markers — narrowed role. The SURFACE decision is now catch-everything

# the sole findings signal. They do two narrower jobs: (1) the MIXED-review guard — a body
# with a clean phrase ("Bugs: no issues found") AND a finding marker ("Docstrings missing")
# is NOT clean; (2) severity in the render. They're STRUCTURAL, not security-keyword-prose
# (a clean review NAMES the concepts it checked — "the privilege-escalation guard looks
# correct" — so privilege/escalation/security would false-positive on clean prose):
#   • numbered/sectioned headers `#### ` / `### [0-9]`; file-grouped header `### ` + backtick

#   • the count line `<N> issue(s)/bug(s)/… found` with a NON-"no" quantifier ("One issue
#     found.") — the clean phrase "No … found" is in CLAUDE_CLEAN_PATTERNS, no collision;
#   • report-list words `missing` / `violation` / ❌.
# Because the surface default is now "not-provably-clean → surface", a marker MISSING on a
# findings body no longer false-cleans it (it's surfaced anyway) — markers can only fail
# in the SAFE direction now. (Format is non-deterministic — PR #169 posted "One issue
