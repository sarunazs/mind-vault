# /review-loop

Drive a review-fix-rerun cycle on the given PR using one or more review engines concurrently.

**Inputs**:

- `PR_NUMBER` (optional; defaults to PR for the current branch)
- `ENGINES` (optional; defaults to all engines with available adapters + tool scripts — currently `bugbot,copilot`)

**Usage**:

```
/review-loop                     # current branch's PR, all available engines
/review-loop 129                 # PR #129, all available engines
/review-loop 129 bugbot          # PR #129, bugbot only (equivalent to /bugbot-loop 129)
/review-loop 129 bugbot,copilot  # PR #129, both engines (dual-engine sync mode)
```

When `|ENGINES| > 1`, the loop runs in **multi-engine sync mode** — each cycle waits for the slowest engine's verdict before batching fixes and retriggering all engines. See [`skills/review-loop/references/dual-engine-sync.md`](../skills/review-loop/references/dual-engine-sync.md) for the synchronisation contract, trade-off escape hatches, and asymmetric-clearance hand-back semantics.

## Behaviour

This command invokes [`skills/review-loop/SKILL.md`](../skills/review-loop/SKILL.md) with the given engine list. The skill enforces:

- `max_commits_per_session = 20`
- `max_active_work_minutes = 180`
- `max_idle_polls = 20`
- Per-engine spacing ≥5 min between same-engine retriggers
- Feature-branch sandbox (per `RULE_git-safety`); never main, never force-push to protected.

## Engine selection

The `ENGINES` argument is a comma-separated list. Currently supported:

- `bugbot` — Cursor Bugbot (`tools/find_bugbot_comments.sh`, `tools/bugbot_retrigger.sh`)
- `copilot` — GitHub Copilot (`tools/find_copilot_comments.sh`, `tools/copilot_retrigger.sh`)

To add a new engine, see [`skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md`](../skills/review-loop/references/engine-adapter-contract.md) § Adding a new engine.

## Related commands

- [`/bugbot-loop`](bugbot-loop.md) — single-engine wrapper, equivalent to `/review-loop <PR> bugbot`.
- [`/copilot-loop`](copilot-loop.md) — single-engine wrapper, equivalent to `/review-loop <PR> copilot`.

The single-engine wrappers exist for ergonomics and backward compatibility; `/review-loop` is the canonical multi-engine entry.

## Hand-back

The loop hands back to the user with:

- Per-engine verdict (CLEAN / HUNG / ERRORED / STILL_FINDING).
- Asymmetric-clearance warning if one engine cleared and another didn't.
- Tier 3 escalations (need human decision).
- Pending retriggers not fired (if budget exhaustion prevented them).
- PR URL.

The loop never merges. The merge to a protected branch is always the human's decision.
