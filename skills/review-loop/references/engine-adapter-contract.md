# Engine adapter contract

Every review engine that plugs into `skills/review-loop/SKILL.md` must satisfy this contract. Adapters live under `skills/review-loop/references/engine-<name>.md` and consist of two surfaces:

1. **Tool surface** — shell scripts under `tools/<engine>_*.sh` that the orchestrator invokes.
2. **Reference surface** — the `engine-<name>.md` file itself, documenting parsing rules, failure modes, and Common-Patterns codification.

The orchestrator (`SKILL.md`) only calls into the tool surface. The reference surface is consumed by the agent (Claude) reading the adapter doc when triaging findings or interpreting unusual signals.

## Adapter categories

Adapters fall into two trigger/state shapes. The orchestrator's phase logic is identical for both — the difference is entirely inside the `find_*` / `*_retrigger` scripts and documented in the engine's reference surface.

| Category | Trigger model | Review-state source | Clean source | Staleness anchor | Instances |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Check-run / request-driven** | Idle until explicitly retriggered (`*_retrigger.sh` fires post-push + on the zero-activity bootstrap) | A **named check-run** on the head SHA; `STATUS` → RUNNING/DONE | DONE + zero active findings; `CONCLUSION=success` is a meaningful "ran" signal that gates the settle valve | `pull_request_review_id` | `bugbot`, `copilot` |
| **Auto-trigger / comment-anchored** | **Push-triggered** — a CI/Actions hook auto-runs on every push, so a fix push IS the retrigger; the `*_retrigger.sh` is a **fallback** for the no-auto-run bootstrap only | A **CI/Actions job** status (NO named check-run); `STATUS` synthesized → RUNNING/DONE; its conclusion is green regardless of findings, never a verdict | **Model-judge over surfaced material** (IDEA-022 — prose-only surface, see below): the adapter surfaces every verdict body verbatim + `VERDICT_SET_PROVEN`; the `/review-loop` judge emits `{CLEAN \| BLOCKING \| NON_BLOCKING[]}`. The settle valve still releases on comment **presence**, never the job conclusion | A **synthesized comment id** (summary-comment id, or newest head-SHA inline comment id) | `claude` (first instance — [`engine-claude.md`](engine-claude.md)) |

The auto-trigger / comment-anchored category exists because `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` running the `code-review` plugin violates all three check-run-category assumptions (no named check-run, findings are comments not a stateful review, auto-runs on push). The contract accommodates it without orchestrator changes — see the comment-presence settle note in § Review-state gate and the synthesized-anchor case in § Scratch-file state ownership.

> **Clean-source carve-out — prose-only verdict surfaces (IDEA-022).** "Clean is structural, never prose" holds for engines with a **structured verdict surface** (bugbot/copilot — severity-tagged findings a machine reads). An engine whose verdict *is* prose with **no structured surface** (claude — no severity JSON, no named check-run) is the exception: its adapter SURFACES the material (RUNNING/DONE, the verbatim verdict-body enumeration, `VERDICT_SET_PROVEN`) and a **model-judge** classifies it (`{CLEAN \| BLOCKING \| NON_BLOCKING[]}` — see [`engine-claude.md`](engine-claude.md) § Verdict judge + [`../SKILL.md`](../SKILL.md) § Per-engine model-judge). The structural backstops stay in the adapter (the proven-verdict-set fail-closed, the held-RUNNING SILENT guard, the NOOP/draft filters), so a SILENT/unprovable run never reaches the judge and the judge can't be starved of a masked verdict. A future prose-only engine inherits this carve-out by the same *absence-of-structured-surface* criterion — it is not claude-specific.

**Two cross-cutting hazards every auto-trigger engine inherits** (learned from `claude`'s bring-up — fold into any future auto-trigger adapter):

- **DRAFT PRs may run-but-post-nothing.** A push-triggered engine fires on draft-PR pushes and concludes `success`, but the vendor may post no review on a draft (claude does exactly this) — which reads as a silent / false-clean vector, *not* clean. Mitigate at **both** layers: (1) the orchestration cadence — `/work` opens PRs draft to suppress per-WIP-commit billing on the push-triggered engine, and `/review-loop` un-drafts (`gh pr ready`) pre-flight before Phase 1; (2) the adapter — a `find_*` draft probe emitting `<ENGINE>_DRAFT_NOOP=true` + early-exit as a belt-and-suspenders so a skipped un-draft surfaces "no verdict until ready," never SILENT/HUNG/clean. Check-run/request-driven engines (bugbot, copilot) are on-demand and unaffected by draft state.
- **Per-commit billing.** Because a fix push auto-runs the engine, a non-draft PR bills a review on *every* push. The draft-until-review cadence above is the lever that collapses that to one review per finalized change (critical under sprint-auto, which pushes many commits across many IDEAs unattended).

## Tool surface — required scripts

Every adapter MUST provide these scripts (project-local, `tools/<engine>_*.sh`). The orchestrator invokes them by name; the contract is the script's stdout shape.

> **⚠️ CWD / repo-resolution gotcha — invoke from the TARGET PROJECT's checkout.** These scripts shell out to `gh`, which resolves the repo from the **CWD's git remote** unless given `-R owner/repo`. When the scripts live in a *shared* tools dir (mind-vault symlinked / cloned separately from the project under review), running them with the shared dir as CWD makes `gh` query the *wrong* repo — the PR won't resolve, `find_*` reports a false **"no activity yet"**, `*_retrigger` fails with `Could not resolve to a PullRequest`. The false "no activity" is the dangerous one — the orchestrator may wrongly take the zero-activity branch or miss findings. **Invoke by absolute path with CWD = the project under review** (`cd <project> && /path/to/shared/tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh <PR>`), or hardcode `gh -R` in the script. When in doubt, cross-check with `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<PR>/reviews` — authoritative and CWD-independent.

> **⚠️ Stale-local-adapter fallback — when the project's committed `tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh` is BEHIND the canonical (mind-vault) version, run the canonical one; do NOT skip the review.** The project copy is a *port* — it lags whenever the canonical adapter gains a capability the port hasn't been re-synced to. The dangerous case is a parser-capability gap: e.g. a pre-C1 claude adapter only reads inline comments, so it reports CLEAN while claude posted findings in the `## Code review` **summary-comment body** it can't parse (a **false CLEAN** — the exact failure C1 closed). The CWD trick above already lets you run any script against any project (`cd <project>`), so the fallback is free: **`cd <project> && bash <mind-vault>/tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh <PR>`** uses the current parser against the project's PR. Belt-and-suspenders, engine-agnostic, always-available: read the raw verdict directly — for claude, the `claude[bot]` summary-comment body (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<PR>/comments`) plus inline (`.../pulls/<PR>/comments`). Re-syncing the project port (a `/compound`-style copy of the canonical scripts) is the durable fix; the canonical-script run is what unblocks the review *now*. Trigger to watch for: you just shipped a canonical-adapter upgrade but the project's port PR hasn't merged yet.

### `tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh <PR_NUMBER>`

Emit zero or more marker lines on stdout. **Order is not guaranteed** — the orchestrator parses by anchor-based grep on `^<ENGINE>_<MARKER>=` rather than positional reading. Adapters MAY emit markers in any order, MAY interleave informational output (banners, summaries) between markers, and SHOULD prefer printing markers as early as possible after their underlying data is fetched. The marker set (each emitted when its underlying data exists — see per-line notes and the semantics below):

```text
<ENGINE>_LATEST_REVIEW=<review-id> COMMIT=<sha> AT=<iso8601> [CLEAN=<bool>]   # trailing CLEAN= is legacy/ignored; parsers must tolerate extra trailing fields
[<ENGINE>_CHECKRUN=<id> COMMIT=<sha> STATUS=<queued|in_progress|completed> CONCLUSION=<...> AT=<iso8601>]   # state gate — emitted when a check-run exists on the head SHA; ABSENCE = NOT_TRIGGERED or TRIGGERED (check-run not yet created). STATUS: RUNNING (queued/in_progress) vs DONE (completed)
[<ENGINE>_CLEAN_SIGNAL=<review-id> COMMIT=<sha> AT=<iso8601>]   # legacy, non-authoritative — orchestrator derives clean structurally (DONE + zero active findings), NOT from this line
```

Followed by zero or more inline-finding blocks. The exact display format is implementation-defined — current `tools/find_*_comments.sh` scripts emit ANSI-coloured + markdown-bold output (`**File:**`, separator lines, etc.) for human readability. The orchestrator consumes findings by anchor-based grep on the `(comment id <cid>, review <rid>)` token, so adapters MAY choose any human-readable layout as long as **every finding block includes this token verbatim**. Recommended fields per block (any layout):

- `Severity: <LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH|CRITICAL|INFO>`
- `(comment id <cid>, review <rid>)` — **mandatory** identifier-pair
- `thread <PRRT_…>` — **recommended**: the review-thread node id for the finding's thread. Lets Phase 3's forward auto-resolve ([`THREAD_AUTO_RESOLVE.md`](THREAD_AUTO_RESOLVE.md) Pattern 1) call `resolveReviewThread` without a second `reviewThreads` round-trip. When absent the orchestrator falls back to the inline GraphQL query mapping `comment id → thread id`. Comment-anchored engines that synthesize a comment id should surface the enclosing thread id here.
- `File: <path>` (line number optional — see line-number-drift caveat in the orchestrator)
- `Title: <short title>` (free-text; may be a placeholder for engines without titles)
- `Description: <body>` (free-text)
- `Link: <github URL>` (optional, for forensics)

Followed by an empty line, then optionally:

```text
💡 PR: <github URL>
```

**Required semantics:**

- `<ENGINE>` literal is uppercase engine name (e.g. `BUGBOT`, `COPILOT`, `CLAUDE`).
- `<ENGINE>_LATEST_REVIEW` is **mandatory** when any review exists for the PR — the orchestrator's staleness rule depends on it. It may carry a trailing legacy `CLEAN=<bool>` token; the orchestrator ignores it (clean is structural), and parsers must tolerate extra trailing fields.
- `<ENGINE>_CHECKRUN` is the **review-state gate**, emitted whenever the engine has a check-run on the head SHA. Its **absence means the engine has no check-run for this SHA yet** — either `NOT_TRIGGERED` (no retrigger fired) or `TRIGGERED` (retrigger fired, check-run not yet created); Phase 4 distinguishes them by whether a trigger fired this SHA, so absence alone must not prompt a re-trigger. When present, `STATUS` maps to `RUNNING` (`queued`/`in_progress`) vs `DONE` (`completed`); `CONCLUSION` is a run outcome, never a clean verdict. A `completed` check-run must not be surfaced as DONE until a review for the head SHA has posted — with one exception, the **success-only settle valve** (a `success` review-less check-run is trusted after the window; a non-success one never is). See § Review-state gate's review-pending guard for the full rule.
- `<ENGINE>_CLEAN_SIGNAL` is **legacy and non-authoritative**: the orchestrator derives clean structurally (engine `DONE` + zero active findings across the head-SHA verdict set — `LATEST_REVIEW` for single-verdict engines; every head-SHA verdict for multi-verdict engines per the core skill's § Staleness carve-out), never from this line. A script MAY still emit it; the orchestrator ignores it for the verdict.
- Each inline finding must include the `review <rid>` token so the orchestrator can filter active findings vs persistent-thread stale findings. For single-verdict engines that's `rid == LATEST_REVIEW`; for multi-verdict engines (claude — see `engine-claude.md` § dual substantive verdicts) the active set spans every substantive verdict on the head SHA, so the script must let the orchestrator see them all (emit per-verdict ids/timestamps, not just the newest).
- The `COMMIT=<sha>` on `LATEST_REVIEW` is the trigger-anchor SHA; the authoritative review state is the `CHECKRUN STATUS` for the current head SHA.
- Exit code 0 on success (regardless of whether findings exist); non-zero only on auth/network failure.

### `tools/<engine>_retrigger.sh <PR_NUMBER>`

Trigger a new review for the PR. Engine-specific mechanism (comment post for bugbot, reviewer remove+add for copilot, etc.).

**Required semantics:**

- Exit code 0 on success.
- Hard-coded body / action so the script can be pre-approved in `~/.claude/settings.json` without permission prompts on each call.
- Idempotent against pre-existing pending reviews — calling twice should not break the engine's queue (the orchestrator only retriggers post-push or from the zero-activity bootstrap, never while RUNNING, but the script must not crash if the engine is already mid-review).
- **Recommended (not required)**: print a tracking reference to stdout — the GitHub URL of the action taken (comment URL for comment-based engines like bugbot) or a status line. Useful for log forensics but not consumed by the orchestrator.

## Reference surface — required sections

Every `engine-<name>.md` MUST include the following sections, in this order:

### § Identity

Engine name, vendor, what the user sees in the GitHub UI (e.g. "cursor[bot]" for bugbot, "Copilot" for copilot). The orchestrator filters PR comments/reviews by `user.login` matching this identity.

> ⚠️ **Calibrate identity (and any posting behavior) off a run that ACTUALLY PRODUCED the signal — never a no-op / clean / empty run.** A run that posted nothing tells you nothing about the author login, comment shape, or `review_id` grouping; "confirming" identity from it is guessing. (Field lesson: `claude`'s first dogfood "confirmed" `github-actions[bot]` off a clean run that posted no review content — the real review identity, `claude[bot]`, was visible only once a *findings-bearing* run actually posted. The over-broad login tuple kept detection working, but the doc was wrong for days.) Lock identity/shape on the first run that posts real findings; until then, ship a conservative over-broad filter that fails toward "keep polling," never a false clean.

### § Tool invocations

The literal shell commands the orchestrator dispatches:

- `tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh <PR>` — output shape per contract above.
- `tools/<engine>_retrigger.sh <PR>` — semantics per contract above.

Any engine-specific quirks (e.g. Copilot's bare `--add-reviewer` no-op against already-requested reviewers) documented inline.

### § Review-state + clean detection

Document the engine's check-run (name / app-slug) and how `STATUS` maps to `RUNNING`/`DONE`. Clean is structural: `DONE` + zero active findings across the head-SHA verdict set (`LATEST_REVIEW` for single-verdict engines). If the script also emits a legacy `CLEAN_SIGNAL` (e.g. a review-body marker), note it as corroboration only — the orchestrator does not consume it for the verdict.

### § Staleness rule

Engine-specific staleness semantics if any. The default contract (active iff `review.id == LATEST_REVIEW`) is uniform across single-verdict engines; engines with persistent-thread quirks (bugbot: stale findings linger in `/comments` until manual resolve) or multiple substantive verdicts per head SHA (claude: staleness ages out by SHA, not review id — every head-SHA verdict stays active; see `engine-claude.md` § dual substantive verdicts) document them here.

### § Race-condition caveats

Any engine-specific race conditions between review-firing and SHA observation. Document the timestamp tiebreaker and docs-only-commit skip-retrigger heuristic.

### § Failure modes

Engine-specific failure signatures the orchestrator must recognise:

- Stall / hang patterns (bugbot: `BUGBOT_CHECKRUN STATUS=in_progress` >15 min; copilot: review never posts within ~10× normal latency).
- Service-error patterns (copilot's literal `"Copilot encountered an error..."` body).
- Rate-limit patterns.

Each failure mode mapped to an orchestrator action (proceed with other engines, hand back, etc.).

### § Common patterns (codified Tier 1 findings)

Engine-specific recurring findings the orchestrator can auto-fix without per-finding approval. The shared cross-engine catalogue lives in [`common-review-findings.md`](common-review-findings.md); an adapter's § Common patterns section links there and documents only its engine-specific deltas.

### § Review-state gate

The adapter MUST expose its engine's check-run on the PR head as `<ENGINE>_CHECKRUN ... STATUS=<status>`, mapping the engine's native status to `queued`/`in_progress` (**RUNNING**) and `completed` (**DONE**). The orchestrator gates on this: it never reads a verdict while RUNNING and never retriggers except after a push or from the zero-activity bootstrap — so no inter-retrigger interval exists. `CONCLUSION` is a run outcome, never a clean verdict.

**Review-pending guard — a `completed` check-run is NOT a verdict until a review for the head SHA has posted.** Engines flip their check-run to `completed` *before* the review / inline-comment objects land (observed: copilot, 3m42s lag, PR #148). A poll in that gap sees DONE + zero findings, and the orchestrator's structural clean (DONE + zero active findings) fires a **false CLEAN**, shipping the about-to-post findings unreviewed — `CONCLUSION` doesn't help, whatever its value: it reports the *run's* outcome, not whether the inline review / comment objects have landed (and it varies by engine — Copilot concludes `success` even with findings, Bugbot concludes non-success on findings). So an adapter MUST NOT report DONE off **any** `completed` check-run — *regardless of `CONCLUSION`* — until a review for the head SHA has posted (a `LATEST_REVIEW` whose `COMMIT` == head SHA). The downgrade is conclusion-agnostic on purpose: an engine that concludes **non-success on findings** (e.g. Bugbot) would otherwise slip a findings check-run that completes before its comments post straight through to DONE + zero-findings = false CLEAN. `CONCLUSION=success` gates **only** the `CLEAN_SIGNAL` synthesis (non-success ⇒ findings ⇒ never synthesize clean), never the DONE-suppression. Until that review posts, downgrade the emitted `STATUS` to `in_progress` (the orchestrator keeps waiting) and MAY emit an informational `<ENGINE>_REVIEW_PENDING=...` marker. A settle valve (`<ENGINE>_REVIEW_SETTLE_SECONDS`, default 600) trusts a review-less check-run as DONE after the window elapses **only when its conclusion is `success`** (the rare clean-check-run-only case, so it doesn't poll to the idle timeout). A **non-success** review-less check-run is **never** trusted — it signaled findings, but the review/comments never arrived, so trusting it would report findings as clean; keep it non-DONE (held → idle-timeout HUNG → human investigates the missing review). Both shipped adapters implement this (`find_copilot_comments.sh`, `find_bugbot_comments.sh`); any new engine whose `find_*` synthesizes clean from a check-run MUST too. Compute the settle age in Python `datetime` (cross-platform), never `date -d` (GNU-only; fails on BSD/macOS and pins the guard permanently on).

**Comment-anchored engines gate DONE on comment PRESENCE, not conclusion.** An auto-trigger / comment-anchored engine (see § Adapter categories) has no native check-run *and* no conclusion that ever signals findings — its synthesized RUNNING/DONE comes from a CI/Actions job whose conclusion is green regardless of what it found. For such an engine the settle valve **must** release on comment presence (or, on a genuine empty-result no-comment case, the zero-inline clean arm) and **never** on the job conclusion — a conclusion gate would always release and ship lagged findings as a false CLEAN. The success-only settle valve above applies to **check-run** engines (copilot, bugbot) where a `success` conclusion is a meaningful "ran clean" signal; it does NOT transfer to comment-anchored engines. `claude` is the first instance — see [`engine-claude.md`](engine-claude.md) § Race-condition caveats for the load-bearing divergence.

## Scratch-file state ownership

The orchestrator owns the per-engine state slots in the loop's scratch file under `~/.claude/memory/projects/<project-slug>/review-loop-pr-<N>.md` (placeholder `<project-slug>` standardised across all review-loop docs). Adapters do NOT write directly to scratch; the orchestrator updates state based on adapter outputs.

Per-engine state slots:

- `<engine>_review_state` — `NOT_TRIGGERED` | `TRIGGERED` | `RUNNING` | `DONE` for the current head SHA (from the engine's check-run `STATUS`)
- `last_seen_<engine>_review` — `<id> @ <sha>` (LATEST_REVIEW last acted on; staleness anchor)
- `last_seen_<engine>_signal_id` — most recent processed inline finding id (engine-defined: comment id for comment-based engines; unset until first review for reviewer-assignment engines; for **comment-anchored** engines whose `LATEST_REVIEW` anchor is a *synthesized summary-comment id* — see § Adapter categories — it's that summary-comment id, falling back to the newest head-SHA inline comment id when no summary exists)

## Adding a new engine

To add a new engine (e.g. CodeRabbit, a hypothetical new vendor):

1. Decide the adapter **category** (§ Adapter categories) — check-run/request-driven or auto-trigger/comment-anchored. The category dictates where review-state and clean come from and whether the retrigger is primary or fallback.
2. Author `skills/review-loop/references/engine-<name>.md` following the section template above.
3. Implement `tools/find_<engine>_comments.sh` and `tools/<engine>_retrigger.sh` per the tool-surface contract.
4. Add `<name>` to the recognised engine list in `commands/review-loop.md` § Engine selection and the `ENGINES` enum in `review-loop/SKILL.md` (the user-visible surfaces).
5. **If the engine should join the *default* engine set**, gate it on a **reachability probe** in `find_<engine>_comments.sh` (e.g. claude probes for its `claude-code-review.yml` workflow). Where the engine is not provisioned on the target repo, emit a `<ENGINE>_NOT_INSTALLED=true` marker + exit 0 so the orchestrator's default resolution self-excludes it (degrade loudly on an explicit invocation, never HUNG). An engine with no per-repo provisioning step (bugbot, copilot) needs no probe.
6. Wire the **sync-doc touchpoints** in [`multi-engine-sync.md`](multi-engine-sync.md): add the engine's stall/error rows to the trade-off escape-hatch table, its `<engine>_review_state` / `last_seen_<engine>_*` scratch slots, its slot in the alphabetical retrigger order (noting any push-triggered/fallback-only retrigger so Phase 3 skips it), and extend the asymmetric-clearance hand-back template to cover the new engine count.
7. Optionally add `commands/<name>-loop.md` as a thin single-engine wrapper.

`SKILL.md` itself processes engines from the `ENGINES` argument generically and does not enumerate them by name in code — adding a new engine does not require structural changes to the orchestrator's phase logic. The "no changes required" applies to the orchestrator's algorithmic surface; the user-facing engine list lives in `commands/review-loop.md` so it can document what the user can pass.

## Calibration discipline (how to get an adapter's clean/findings split right)

A review engine's posted output is **not a stable, documented format** — it is model-generated prose that varies run to run (claude alone posts findings as "One issue found." + ``### `file` `` headers, as `#### 1.` numbered sections, and as mixed "Bugs: no issues / Docstrings: missing" reviews; no-ops as both "Skipped …" and "Skipping …"). Three rules keep an adapter's classifier safe under that non-determinism — learned the hard way dogfooding the claude adapter on the PR that shipped it (mind-vault #169):

1. **Surface is catch-everything, marker-INDEPENDENT.** Decide *findings* as `posted ∧ ¬provably-clean`, NOT `matched a known finding-marker`. A posted, non-no-op review is therefore ALWAYS either provably-clean (a positive clean phrase AND no finding marker — the mixed-review guard) or surfaced-as-findings. Markers may inform the *clean* determination and severity, but must never be the *sole* gate that decides whether to surface — an unseen future finding format would then read as SILENT/clean, the one unsafe direction. Over-surfacing a clean-but-novel-phrased review is the safe failure (the loop reads it and resolves); dropping a findings review is not.
2. **Dogfood the adapter on a PR that exercises its own finding-shape.** A synthetic/unit test feeds the adapter *your* assumed format and passes; only a live review on a real PR posts the shapes you didn't anticipate. Running the engine on the very PR that changes its adapter is the highest-yield test (it caught five real calibration bugs in one pass for claude).
3. **Validate against the full real corpus, not the count a summary claims.** When calibration cites "N NOOP / M FINDINGS" from a source PR, re-run the classifier over *every* body in that PR's intact review history (`gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>/comments`) and confirm the split + **zero false-cleans / zero false-SILENT** yourself — the cited count can be an off-by-one (the claude calibration's "2 NOOP" was really 3).

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Surfacing findings ONLY when a known finding-marker matches. Engine output format is non-deterministic; a marker list always lags a new format → false-SILENT (findings dropped). Default to surface-unless-provably-clean (§ Calibration discipline).
- ❌ Adapter writes directly to the orchestrator's scratch file. The orchestrator owns scratch; adapters expose stdout shape only.
- ❌ Engine-specific decision-tree branches in the orchestrator. If an engine needs special-case handling, lift it into the adapter contract (e.g. service-error retry-budget) or hand back to the user.
- ❌ Cross-engine knowledge in an adapter (e.g. bugbot's adapter referencing copilot's check-run name). Each adapter is self-contained; cross-engine coordination lives in `multi-engine-sync.md` and the orchestrator.
- ❌ Skipping the `review <rid>` token in `find_comments.sh` output. The orchestrator's staleness filter depends on it.
