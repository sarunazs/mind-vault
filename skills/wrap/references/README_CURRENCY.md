# README currency audit — keep the whole README honest, not just the IDEA's identifiers

Step 6's per-identifier scan patches what *this* IDEA touched. Nothing makes any
single wrap responsible for the **whole** README, so it drifts across many IDEAs:
version framing, counts, feature tables, stale ⚠️ flags. This is the devlog
backfill-gap rule (Step 4 §2) applied to the README. Step 6b fires it on a
staleness threshold and patches mechanical drift in-wrap.

## When this fires

Step 6b runs **after** Step 6's per-identifier loop, gated three ways:

1. **Scope** — eligible under `--scope=docs` (the default); **skipped under
   `--scope=idea-only`** (per-IDEA sprint-auto wraps; the batch wrap is the audit
   point — see *Sprint-auto asymmetry*).
2. **Staleness** — count merged PRs on the base branch since the last
   *whole-README audit* (the marker date, not the file mtime). Fire iff
   `count >= N` (default **N = 5**, overridable via the hint block).
3. **Degraded environments** — if `gh` is unavailable (no auth / non-GitHub
   remote), fall back to **calendar staleness**: fire if the marker is absent or
   its date is older than 30 days. Never crash the wrap on a missing `gh` token.

Staleness count (server-side date filter). The gate only needs to know whether
`count >= N`, so cap the query at `N` itself (`--limit "$N"`): if the page comes
back full (`length == N`), at least `N` PRs merged since the marker → stale. This
sidesteps `gh pr list`'s 30-row default page size entirely — no large-cap
guessing, correct for any overridden `N`:

```bash
FIRE=0                                        # init: default skip; a branch below sets 1 only when stale
N=$(grep -oE 'N:[[:space:]]*[0-9]+' README.md | head -1 | grep -oE '[0-9]+'); N=${N:-5}  # hint-block override, else 5
MARKER_DATE=$(grep -oE 'wrap:readme-currency-audited [0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}' README.md | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')  # head -1: tolerate a stray duplicate marker (keep single-line)
BASE=$(gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || echo main)
if [ -z "$MARKER_DATE" ]; then
    FIRE=1                                   # no marker → stale
elif [ "$MARKER_DATE" \> "$(date +%F)" ]; then
    FIRE=1                                   # future-dated / clock-skewed → stale
elif [ "$MARKER_DATE" = "$(date +%F)" ]; then
    :                                        # audited TODAY → skip (FIRE stays 0). Explicit, so same-day
                                             # idempotency holds regardless of how gh interprets `merged:>today`
elif COUNT=$(gh pr list --state merged --base "$BASE" --limit "$N" \
        --search "merged:>$MARKER_DATE" --json number --jq 'length' 2>/dev/null); then
    [ "$COUNT" -ge "$N" ] && FIRE=1          # cap query at N: length==N ⇔ ≥N merged (no paging guesswork)
elif command -v python3 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # gh unavailable → calendar fallback (zero network). Age in days via Python
    # datetime (cross-platform), never `date -d` (GNU-only; fails on BSD/macOS).
    AGE_DAYS=$(python3 -c "import datetime,sys; print((datetime.date.today()-datetime.date.fromisoformat(sys.argv[1])).days)" "$MARKER_DATE")
    [ "$AGE_DAYS" -ge 30 ] && FIRE=1
else
    FIRE=1   # no gh AND no python3 → can't measure staleness, default to audit (never crash)
fi
```

**Same-day idempotency guard:** the explicit `MARKER_DATE = today → skip` branch
means a marker written today never re-fires the audit the same day — regardless of
how `gh` interprets `merged:>today` (which can include same-day merges on an active
base branch). So a same-day re-run (a review cycle touches docs, then `/wrap` runs
again) never double-audits: the first run writes today's marker, the re-run hits the
same-day branch and skips. No per-run special-casing.

## The marker

A single HTML comment (invisible in rendered markdown), conventionally at the
**foot** of the README:

```html
<!-- wrap:readme-currency-audited 2026-06-03 -->
```

- **Read** at Step 6b entry (recipe above).
- **Write/refresh** to today's date whenever the audit *runs* — even a clean
  audit that patched nothing still resets it (the README *was* reviewed whole).
  This makes the cadence self-regulating.
- **Atomic with its patches.** Write the marker in the **same commit/branch as
  the README edits the audit produced** — pre-merge: the feature branch;
  post-merge fallback: the `docs/idea-NNN-wrap` cleanup branch. Never write the
  marker on a different ref than the audit. Guarantees *marker present ⟺ audit ran
  on this ref*; an abandoned cleanup PR simply never lands the marker → the next
  wrap re-fires (safe).

## Audit probes

Each probe is **no-op-when-absent** (a project without that surface skips the
probe cleanly) and maps its findings onto Step 6's existing dispositions —
**patch-now-mechanical** vs **flag-as-follow-up**. No new disposition vocabulary.

**Probe 2 fails LOUD, never silent.** The `"Skills (NN)"`-style heading is a
mind-vault artifact; a downstream project counts apps / endpoints / models in
shapes that regex won't match. When **no hint block AND no count-shaped heading
matches**, do **not** report "counts OK" — emit, in the wrap hand-back:
*"README count sources not auto-detectable — declare them in the optional
`wrap:readme-currency` hint block to enable count-drift detection."* Genericity
here means failing loud on the unknown shape, not pattern-matching mind-vault's
shape and calling a non-match clean.

**Large prose / architectural-narrative rewrites are always follow-up**, never
auto-rewritten (IDEA-013 non-goal). The test is Step 6's: if one to three
mechanical edits close the gap, patch now; if a section needs rewriting for a new
architecture, flag it in the PR body.

## Optional per-project hint

Zero-config by default. A project may declare an override block anywhere in the
README (read if present):

```html
<!-- wrap:readme-currency
N: 5
counts:
  skills: ls skills/*/SKILL.md | wc -l
  agents: ls agents/AGENT_*.md | wc -l
  commands: ls commands/*.md | wc -l
-->
```

`N` overrides the staleness threshold; `counts` declares the authoritative source
command per count claim (resolves probe 2's fail-loud case for non-mind-vault
README shapes).

## Sprint-auto asymmetry (intentional)

In sprint-auto, per-IDEA S5 wraps run `--scope=idea-only` → Step 6b is **skipped**
and the marker is **never touched** — even though those wraps may still patch the
README via Step 6's per-identifier scan. The single whole-README audit point for
the cohort is the **S11.7 batch wrap** on the integration branch (a regular,
non-`idea-only` wrap): it fires 6b once and resets the marker. Per-IDEA partial
touches not resetting the marker is the **same insight as the marker design** (a
partial touch is not a whole-README refresh), at batch scale — one audit per
sprint, not N.

## Dogfood note

The first run of this audit was mind-vault's own README during IDEA-013's `/work`
(2026-06-03): it caught the `v4.0.4` headline banner stale against CHANGELOG
`v4.6` (probe 1), verified the `Skills (17)` count (probe 2), and seeded the
marker. See the IDEA-013 archive for the worked diff.
