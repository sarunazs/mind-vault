# RULE_self-sweep-before-push — Recipes, Detailed Sweeps, Rationale

## The Pyflakes Pipe Pattern

Most projects don't ship `pyflakes` in the production image. Two clean ways to run it on demand:

**Project Makefile target** (one-time setup, durable):

```make
self-sweep:
	@docker compose exec -T web pip install --quiet pyflakes 2>/dev/null
	@docker compose exec -T web python -m pyflakes $(PATHS)
```

**One-shot pip install + run** (when no Makefile target exists):

```bash
docker compose exec -T web pip install --quiet pyflakes
docker compose exec -T web python -m pyflakes <changed-files>
```

The pip install is idempotent (no-op if already installed) and free in any reasonable dev image — the marginal cost is ~50ms after the first run.

## Contract-Change Sweep — Full Recipe

Whenever you change a public-facing function's return type, parameter signature, or thrown exceptions, grep for ALL callers in the SAME commit.

The single most common "wasted review-bot cycle" pattern this prevents: a helper changes its contract, you patch the obvious caller, ship it. Bot spots a second caller — often in the SAME file. You fix that, ship. Bot spots a third caller in another file. Three cycles burned on what was one self-contained refactor.

### The grep that catches it

```bash
# JS/TS/Python helper rename:
grep -rn '\bfunctionName(' --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.py" .

# Python method on a class:
grep -rn '\.methodName(' --include="*.py" .
```

Run from the project root, not the file's directory — the bot's review scope is the whole repo, so the sweep must match. The trailing `.` is mandatory: without a path operand, GNU `grep` reads stdin and appears to hang. (If you prefer `rg`, the directory defaults to the current working dir, so the trailing `.` isn't needed.)

### What counts as a contract change worth sweeping

- **Return type changes**: `return undefined` → `return Promise.reject(...)` (any sync→async). Callers without `.catch()` leak unhandled rejections; without `await` they see different behaviour.
- **Throwing where the caller didn't expect**: previously infallible function now raises. Wrap-checking callers crash.
- **Default parameter changes**: previously optional positional now required. Silent regressions everywhere.
- **Async-ifying a sync function**: callers that ignored the return value silently complete out-of-order; races appear intermittently.
- **Removing a side effect**: callers depending on DOM mutation, log emission, cache invalidation silently degrade.

### What does NOT need the sweep

- Pure additions: new optional kwarg, new return field on a dict. Callers ignoring the new surface are unaffected.
- Internal refactors that don't cross the function boundary.
- Adding logging / metrics that don't alter return value or exception shape.

### When the sweep finds many callers

- **All in one file or tight cluster**: handle in the same commit. One atomic diff.
- **Spread across many files / apps**: ship contract change in commit N with backwards-compat shim (returns both old AND new shape); ship per-caller updates in N+1...N+M; remove shim in N+M+1. The shim window prevents an N-file PR blocking on per-file review feedback.

## Defensive-Code Sweep — Full Recipe

When you add a defensive path that READS a field, grep for the WRITE site in the producer code BEFORE shipping the defense. Zero writes = phantom-field guard whose condition is permanently `undefined`.

Failure mode: `if (state.someField)` reads a field that was renamed, never existed, or lives on a different object. The guard *appears* to work — the field is always falsy, so the defensive branch always fires. Its "recovery" (reload, retry, fallback) masks the real bug. Invisible during manual smoke; surfaces only when the defense is later investigated for retirement.

### The grep that catches it

```bash
grep -rn '\b<fieldName>\s*=' <producer-module>/   # assignment
grep -rn '\b<fieldName>\b' <producer-module>/     # widen if assignment uses computed keys
```

For JS module-level stores / Alpine stores / class instances:

```bash
grep -B 2 -A 20 'Alpine.store(.<storeName>' <module>/static/<module>/js/
```

Read every key in the literal. If the field isn't there (and isn't ASSIGNED in any code path), the field doesn't exist — find the correct key or remove the defense.

### When this sweep especially matters

- Any `try`/`catch` whose `try` body reads a field you didn't author (catch silently swallows `TypeError: Cannot read property X of undefined`).
- `if (obj.field)` guards where `obj` comes from a different module / store / library.
- Refactoring a producer that renames internal fields — every consumer's defensive guard now reads a stale name.
- Diagnostic logging that reads state from another module — if `frames` was renamed to `stack`, `console.log('frames:', store.frames)` always prints `undefined` and the diagnostic appears to confirm the field is "empty" when it doesn't exist.

## Touched-Suite Sweep — Full Rationale

Whenever you run a test suite and observe pre-existing failures unrelated to your change, FIX THEM in the same PR. The cost: 5-30 minutes per failure once diagnosed. The benefit: compounds.

### When this fires

- `make test` to verify YOUR change, report shows N failures, M were already failing on parent.
- Forward-merge of an upstream branch surfaces failures invisible when the upstream PR landed.
- A bot review reports findings on tests already failing — bot doesn't distinguish "your fault" and neither should you.

### The rule

If suite reports M pre-existing + N new failures:

1. Triage all M+N together. Don't draw "mine vs theirs" boundary.
2. Identify actual cause per failure (source, test, commit that introduced the breakage).
3. Fix or update each test in the SAME PR. If EXPECTED constant was never updated after a related refactor, update it. If contract is genuinely obsolete, delete the test with explanation.
4. Commit message attributes the introducing change: "Pre-existing failures from IDEA-XXX refactor — EXPECTED constants weren't updated".

### Why this matters

- **Habituation**: known-failing tests train the team to ignore red. Next genuine regression hides behind the same dismissal.
- **Bisect-poisoning**: shipping with red tests means `git bisect` against future regression can't distinguish "this commit caused the failure" from "failure existed all along".
- **Reviewer confusion**: reviewer sees N failures, can't tell which are your responsibility. Either approves blind or asks you to attribute.
- **Compound interest**: every PR shipped with M pre-existing failures grows the noise floor by M. The dominant strategy if everyone follows the discipline is to monotonically decrease the count.

### Anti-pattern

❌ "These 4 failures are pre-existing — I'll file a follow-up issue."

The follow-up issue rarely ships (not attached to a feature cycle). Other engineers apply the same dismissal. Six months later the suite has 40 known-failing tests nobody trusts.

## Scope: Touched Files, Not Just New Edits

When pyflakes flags pre-existing dead imports / unused locals in a file you're editing, clean them up in the same commit (or a `chore(tests):` commit if the diff would otherwise be confusing). Pre-existing findings in touched files are in scope.

**Threshold**: ≤ ~10 mechanical edits → roll into the current PR. > 10 → separate cleanup PR.

## Why This Matters — Top-Level

### The review-bot-cycle math

A bot takes 3-10 minutes per review cycle: comment posted → fetch via API → triage → apply fix → push → re-review. A 1-second pyflakes sweep that catches the same finding eliminates that cycle entirely. For a multi-cycle review-loop on a single PR, every avoided cycle compounds: wall-clock + context-window cost + bot billing.

### Trivial findings dominate the no-progress-loop budget

The review-loop's no-progress detector treats every category-attempt as a budget hit. A trivial dead-import finding consumes the same per-category counter as a substantive bug.

### "Is this commit obviously sloppy" — not "perfectly clean"

Full ruff / mypy passes are PR-time / CI-time concerns. The sweep is the minimum bar.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ "It'll get caught in CI / by the bot eventually" — yes, and each catch is a 3-10 min cycle. The sweep is 1 second.
- ❌ Skip-on-pre-existing — if the file has 5 dead imports and you add a 6th, fixing only the 6th leaves the file in the same state.
- ❌ Run pyflakes from inside an IDE that lints on save — sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, depends on Python interpreter resolution + venv config. Container-side run is authoritative.
- ❌ Suppress with `# noqa: F401` when the import is actually dead — masking, not fixing. Suppress only when the import has a side effect (e.g. registers a Django app's signal handlers).

## Relationship to Other Rules

- [`RULE_git-safety`](../../rules/RULE_git-safety.md) — the sweep runs on the feature branch before push; doesn't change branch policy.
- [`RULE_rename-before-drop`](../../rules/RULE_rename-before-drop.md) — sweeps also catch leftover imports after a rename.
- The review-loop skill should run pyflakes self-sweep between Phase 2 and Phase 3 as a built-in step.
