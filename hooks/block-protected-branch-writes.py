block-protected-branch-writes.py — PreToolUse(Bash) guard that STRUCTURALLY enforces
RULE_git-safety § "never merge or push into a protected branch".

RULE_git-safety is behavioural CONTEXT — it is loaded into the session and relies on the
model obeying it. That is enough right up until judgment lapses on an IRREVERSIBLE op:
an agent, with the rule loaded and quoted back correctly, still ran `gh pr merge` on a
protected `main` — it read a user's "merge" as authorization, where the rule says decline
even then. A behavioural rule cannot self-enforce at the exact moment it's rationalised
away. This hook is the structural backstop: it DENIES the forbidden tool calls at the
source, so a lapse can't move a protected branch's tip. See
docs/rules/RULE_git-safety-rationale.md § "Behavioural rules need a structural backstop".

DENIES (the operations RULE_git-safety forbids on a protected branch):
  • gh pr merge …          — ANY `gh pr merge`, conservatively: the hook does not verify the
                             PR's base branch, so stacked child-into-parent merges are denied
                             too (break-glass covers the rare legitimate case)
  • gh api … writes        — merge / protected-ref-move endpoints (pulls/N/merge, /merges,
                             git/refs/heads/<protected>) WHEN the call carries a write
                             indicator (-X/--method PUT|POST|PATCH|DELETE, or -f/-F/--field/
                             --raw-field/--input, which imply POST). Read-only GET probes of
                             the same endpoints pass through.
  • git push … <protected> — direct push, refspec dest, delete, or force to a protected
                             branch; ALSO a bare `git push` / `git push origin HEAD` while the
                             working tree is checked out on a protected branch (the hook
                             probes the effective directory's current branch, failing open)
  • git branch -f/-D/-M/--force/--delete <protected>  — move/delete a protected tip

ALLOWS (so the feature-branch sandbox still works):
  • git push … <feature-branch>   (incl. --force-with-lease to a feature branch the agent owns)
  • git merge origin/main / git rebase origin/main / git pull --rebase   (forward-sync: the
                                  feature tip moves, the protected tip does not)
  • gh pr create / gh pr ready / gh pr view / every read-only git & gh command
  • command chains where only a non-push segment names a protected branch
    (`git push origin feat && git checkout main` is fine)

Matching is quote-aware and per-command: the raw string is shlex-tokenized, split into
segments at shell operators (&&, ;, |, …), and each `git`/`gh` command start is evaluated
independently — `git -C <path> push`, `git -c k=v push`, quoted refspecs (`"main"`,
HEAD:"main"), and `sudo`/env-prefixed forms all resolve to the same checks, while command
text inside quoted string literals (PR bodies, commit messages) is a single token and
never misread as a command. Heredoc bodies (`<<'EOF' … EOF`) are likewise stripped before
matching — they are data (commit messages, PR bodies) that legitimately QUOTE the very
commands this hook denies. Command strings handed to a shell wrapper (`bash -c "…"`,
`sh -lc '…'`, `eval "…"`) ARE recursed into and checked. On lexer errors (unbalanced
quotes) it falls back to a naive quote-stripped split — degraded matching, still
fail-safe for the common forms.

SCOPE: the hook stops JUDGMENT LAPSES, not deliberate obfuscation — env-var indirection
(`git push origin $BRANCH`), `printf … | bash`, and the like pass through by design
(fail open). An agent *constructing* such a bypass is knowingly violating RULE_git-safety,
which is a behavioural violation no tool-layer guard can close; the break-glass exists so
it never has a legitimate reason to.

BREAK-GLASS: prepend  GIT_SAFETY_ALLOW=1  to the command to bypass — a deliberate, visible,
grep-able opt-in for the rare time the human genuinely means to move a protected branch from
the session. It is honoured ONLY as an env-assignment token in the command's prefix
(`GIT_SAFETY_ALLOW=1 git push …`, incl. after `&&`/`;` or an `env`/`sudo` prefix) — the
token appearing in a trailing `# comment`, a quoted string, or anywhere after the command
word does NOT count (comments are stripped at tokenization, so `git push origin main
# GIT_SAFETY_ALLOW=1` is still denied). The agent must not add it on its own initiative;
a human asking to "merge" is NOT license to add it (that's the exact reasoning the hook
exists to stop).

INSTALL (plugin channel — mind-vault ships this in hooks/hooks.json as a PreToolUse(Bash)
hook, alongside the SessionStart rule-loader). It is a PYTHON script executed via its
shebang — do NOT wrap it in `bash …` like the sibling load-rules.sh entry; bash would parse
it as shell and the guard becomes a silent no-op. Symlink-channel installs register it by
hand in ~/.claude/settings.json under hooks.PreToolUse with matcher "Bash".

Contract: exit 0 + JSON deny  = block;  exit 0 + no output = allow. It FAILS OPEN on any
internal error (a guard bug must never wedge the session — it logs to stderr and allows).
Protected branch names default to main/master/production/deployment; override with the
GIT_SAFETY_PROTECTED env var (comma/space-separated) in the hook's environment. An empty /
whitespace-only override falls back to the defaults (it cannot silently disable the hook).
