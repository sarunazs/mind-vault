# Monitor-accelerated wait — bolt-on accelerator over the ScheduleWakeup spine

The review-loop's Phase 4 wait is driven by a `ScheduleWakeup` re-invocation spine: it survives context compaction and a dropped session, and it is what makes the loop correct. This reference adds a **`Monitor` as a pure accelerator** on top of that spine — it cuts the latency between an engine event and the agent noticing it (from the fixed poll cadence down to ~one poll interval) and avoids burning a full context re-read on every blind wake.

**The accelerator never owns correctness.** If the Monitor is killed, errors, times out, or is auto-stopped by the platform, its absence carries no meaning — the long `ScheduleWakeup` backstop still re-enters Phase 4 and the agent recomputes every engine's state from the adapters. The Monitor is upside that is allowed to fail.

This pattern is written loop-agnostic: any orchestrator that waits on external state via a `ScheduleWakeup` (or equivalent) spine — review-loop here, and sprint-auto's S3/S6/S11.10/S13 review watchers as a future adopter — can arm the same bounded, read-only, emit-once Monitor by citing this file.

## The contract

1. **Read-only.** The poll script calls only `find_<engine>_comments.sh` / `gh api` reads. It MUST NOT invoke any `*_retrigger.sh` — retriggers stay exclusively agent-driven (Phase 1 zero-activity bootstrap + Phase 3 post-push), so billed reviews are never fired by the watcher.
2. **Emit-once, then exit.** The script emits exactly one tagged stdout line the moment the loop could make progress, then exits. One event per Phase 4 entry — not a stream (a chatty Monitor gets auto-stopped by the platform, "too many events").
3. **Aggregate, not per-engine.** One Monitor watches the whole engine set and emits on the aggregate condition. This mirrors the spine: `ScheduleWakeup` already fires a *single* wake carrying the full `<ENGINES>` list (`SKILL.md` Phase 4 step 1), and the agent re-fetches every engine per wake. A per-engine Monitor would emit "engine X finished" events the loop can't act on under multi-engine sync (it waits for the slowest) — wasted wakes, and a needless break from the aggregate-wake symmetry. Also avoids N pollers double-hitting the GitHub API.
4. **The agent is the only authority.** The Monitor signals "worth looking now." Every verdict (CLEAN / STILL_FINDING / HUNG), every triage decision, and the sync gate itself are recomputed by the agent on wake via the unchanged Phase 4 decision tree. The Monitor encodes none of them.

## Trigger conditions — the three events that end the wait

The script emits on the first of these to become true, then exits:

- **`all-done`** — every engine's check-run is `STATUS=completed` for the tracked head SHA. This is exactly the multi-engine sync gate ("wait for the slowest engine") in event form — see [`multi-engine-sync.md`](multi-engine-sync.md).
- **`sha-changed`** — live `git rev-parse HEAD` has diverged from the **frozen arm-time SHA** (an out-of-band push by the user or another process). Compared against the SHA frozen into the script at arm time, NOT two live reads (which move together and never diverge) — this mirrors `SKILL.md` Phase 4 step 3's frozen-baseline new-push detection (`scratch last_push_sha` vs live HEAD) so the two cannot drift.
- **`engine-error`** — an engine reached a genuine **run-level failure** conclusion (`failure` / `cancelled` / `timed_out`) that the escape-hatch table in [`multi-engine-sync.md`](multi-engine-sync.md) acts on. This is a strict subset of, and must stay consistent with, that table. It is explicitly **NOT** triggered by `success`, `neutral`, or `action_required` — those are normal completions (an engine concludes `success`/`neutral` even when it posted inline findings, and `action_required` is "changes requested"; `SKILL.md` § "clean is structural": `CONCLUSION` is a run outcome, never a verdict). Any completion-with-findings is caught by the `all-done` path, so firing `engine-error` on it would only wake the agent into a no-op and risk the auto-stop caveat. (Observed in the IDEA-021 dogfood: bugbot completes findings-bearing reviews as `CONCLUSION=neutral`, not an error.)

## Poll-script template

Armed with the frozen scratch values substituted in. Follows the Monitor idioms: ≥30s cadence for a remote API, `|| true` on transient failure, `cd` pinned inside the loop ([`../../work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md`](../../work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md) Hard Rule 4 — the `find_*` scripts auto-detect the repo from cwd).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# review-loop Phase 4 accelerator — READ-ONLY. Emits ONE event, then exits.
# Substituted at arm time from the scratch file; all values FROZEN for this entry.
# NOTE: pipefail only — do NOT add `set -u`. The Monitor's background shell sources
# the host shell-snapshot, which references optional vars (e.g. ZSH_VERSION) with no
# default; under `set -u` (nounset) that becomes a fatal "unbound variable" that floods
# stderr and disrupts the poll loop, so the script never reaches the all-done emit and
# silently times out. (IDEA-021 dogfood, F-dogfood-4.)

Arm it via `Monitor` with a bounded `timeout_ms` matched to the backstop (e.g. `1200000`), NOT `persistent: true` — see § Lifecycle. `description` should name the PR (`"PR #<N> review engines"`), per the Monitor "specific description" guidance.

## Lifecycle — arm, GC, and the vanished-Monitor rule

- **Arm after the scratch bootstrap write.** The script reads its frozen `ARM_SHA` and engine list from the scratch file's `last_push_sha` / `engines`. On the Phase 1 zero-activity path the scratch bootstrap write is mandatory *before* Phase 4 (`SKILL.md` Phase 1 § "Zero engine activity"); arm the Monitor only **after** that write, never before, or it freezes stale values.
- **`TaskStop` is the GC, and it runs first on every wake.** Unconditionally `TaskStop` the current Monitor as the **first action of every Phase 4 wake** — before the re-fetch, regardless of whether a Monitor event or the `ScheduleWakeup` backstop woke the agent. The emit-once-then-exit contract is the belt; the explicit stop is the real garbage collection ([`../../work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md`](../../work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md) Hard Rule 2 — exit-condition self-clean is bug-prone; a future edit that breaks the exit condition would otherwise leave a zombie poller, Failure Mode D). Whenever the decision tree keeps the loop in Phase 4, the re-arm is **not optional** — it is bundled with the `ScheduleWakeup` into the single "wait state" the looping branches enter (`SKILL.md` Phase 4 step 1). A branch that schedules a wait without re-arming the Monitor disables fast detection after the first wake (the `TaskStop` above leaves nothing running) — the failure mode the IDEA-021 dogfood's bugbot pass flagged.
- **A vanished Monitor is a silent no-op — never a signal.** If the Monitor is killed, errors out, hits its timeout, or is auto-stopped by the platform, its absence means nothing. The agent must never infer `all-done` (or any state) from a missing or silent Monitor — the long `ScheduleWakeup` backstop remains the sole correctness path and the agent recomputes state from the adapters on its next wake.

## Why a bounded `timeout_ms` here does NOT violate WATCHER_HYGIENE Hard Rule 3

[`WATCHER_HYGIENE.md`](../../work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md) Hard Rule 3 forbids wall-clock timeouts on watcher loops — but that rule is scoped to **test-running watchers**, where a timeout small enough to garbage-collect is small enough to kill a legitimately-long (30+ min) test suite (its provenance is a 5h45m test shell). A read-only PR poller gates **no long compute job**: its emit-once-and-exit contract means a bounded `timeout_ms` only ever kills a *stuck* poller, which is the desired GC, not collateral damage. So here the timeout is acceptable as belt-and-suspenders behind the primary explicit-`TaskStop` GC. This carve-out is narrow: it applies to read-only API pollers only, never to test/build watchers.

## Scaling — GitHub API budget

One aggregate Monitor per Phase 4 entry, polled at ≥30s, bounded by per-entry re-arm + mandatory `TaskStop` (above), keeps poller count to one-per-active-loop. This is what bounds API consumption under sprint-auto's concurrent review cycles — without the per-entry re-arm + explicit stop, watchers accumulate and double-poll ([`WATCHER_HYGIENE.md`](../../work/references/WATCHER_HYGIENE.md) Failure Mode A). The aggregate (not per-engine) choice keeps it at one `find_*` sweep per interval rather than N.
