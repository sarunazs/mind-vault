# Description: Install Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) on Debian/Ubuntu from Google's official apt repo
# Usage: sudo ./install/install-gcloud-cli.sh [--check] [--with-components COMP[,COMP...]]
# Supports: Debian 11+ (bullseye, bookworm, trixie), Ubuntu 20.04+ (focal, jammy, noble, etc.)
#
# Why: Projects that talk to Google Cloud (GCP APIs, Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run,
# Secret Manager, etc.) need `gcloud`. Google's own install paths are either:
#   (a) curl | bash convenience script that drops an SDK into $HOME — fine for a dev
#       box, poor for VPS / shared systems where multiple users expect gcloud on PATH;
#   (b) copy-paste apt repo + GPG key setup — correct but error-prone and the docs
#       still show the deprecated `apt-key add` flow.
# This script takes path (b) done right: keyring dropped into /usr/share/keyrings,
# repo file signed-by that keyring, no `apt-key`. System-wide install, auto-updates
# via `apt upgrade`, auditable, repeatable.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Idempotency check: exit early if gcloud is already installed and reports a version.
#   2. OS detection via /etc/os-release — refuses anything other than debian/ubuntu.
#   3. Installs apt prerequisites (ca-certificates, curl, gnupg, apt-transport-https).
#   4. Drops Google Cloud's apt signing key into /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg
#      (dearmored; no deprecated `apt-key`).
#   5. Writes /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list pointing at the cloud-sdk
#      apt channel (same repo for all supported Debian/Ubuntu versions — Google ships
#      a single `cloud-sdk main` distribution, not per-codename).
#   6. apt-get update + apt-get install google-cloud-cli.
#   7. Optionally installs extra components via --with-components (e.g. gke-gcloud-auth-plugin,
#      kubectl, cloud-sql-proxy). Each becomes a separate apt package (google-cloud-cli-<comp>).
#   8. Verifies with `gcloud --version` and prints a hint to run `gcloud init`.
#
# Flags:
#   --check                    Report current install state and exit. No writes.
#   --with-components LIST     Comma-separated extra components to install alongside
#                              the base CLI. Each resolves to an apt package named
#                              google-cloud-cli-<component>. Examples:
#                                --with-components gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
#                                --with-components gke-gcloud-auth-plugin,cloud-sql-proxy
#                              Full package list: `apt-cache search google-cloud-cli-`
#                              after the base install.
