# Audit newly-reachable code before merging a bug fix

When fixing a bug whose pre-fix behaviour **short-circuited a code path** (the buggy code "did nothing visible", silently dropped a value, never entered a branch, never opened a UI surface), audit the **now-reachable code** for latent secondary bugs **before merging the fix**. The secondary bugs were masked while the primary bug short-circuited the path; they go from "invisible" to "visibly wrong" the moment the primary fix lands.

## Why this matters

A bug fix that turns a previously dead-end path into a live path **changes the symptom of every latent issue downstream of the fix**. Where the user previously saw "nothing happens" (the worse bug), they now see "the wrong thing happens" (the latent bug that was always there, just hidden).

The cost of not auditing is two-fold:

1. **The user perceives the fix as a regression.** They've never seen the latent issue before — the primary fix is what made it visible. From their seat, the symptom is new, and the new symptom landed in the fix's commit. Blame attaches to the fix, not the pre-existing gap.
2. **A second fix-cycle costs more than auditing once.** The user reports the "regression", the agent investigates, discovers it's pre-existing, and ships a follow-on commit. That whole cycle was avoidable: one audit pass at the moment of writing the primary fix would have surfaced the latent issue and let both fixes ship together.

The discipline this reference encodes: **a fix removes a layer of camouflage from the code it touches**, and the audit at fix-time is the only cheap moment to find what the camouflage was hiding.

## When this applies

- **Empty-input / empty-state guards added to a primitive.** Pre-fix: empty input fell through silently. Post-fix: empty input goes through the normal flow. Audit: does the normal flow handle empty / minimally-populated frames the way real frames are handled?
- **Short-circuit returns removed.** Pre-fix: early-return on a flag prevented downstream code from running. Post-fix: the flag is gone and downstream code runs unconditionally. Audit: did anything downstream silently rely on the early-return as an invariant ("we never get here when X is true")?
- **Missing call inserted.** Pre-fix: code path lacked an `init()` / `open()` / `register()` call so the side effect never happened. Post-fix: the call fires. Audit: do all the downstream consumers of that side effect produce sensible output with the freshly-initialised state?
- **Async / promise chain fixed to actually resolve.** Pre-fix: a callback never fired because of a missing `.then()` / `await`. Post-fix: the callback fires. Audit: does the callback's payload have the shape the consumer expects, or was it always going to crash on first real invocation?
- **Type-gate / permission-gate relaxed.** Pre-fix: a check rejected some inputs that should have been accepted. Post-fix: more inputs reach the consumer. Audit: does the consumer handle the freshly-accepted shapes, or was it tested only against the narrower pre-fix set?

Does **not** apply to: bug fixes that *narrow* a code path's reach (adding stricter validation, removing a fallback that was wrong, tightening a type). Those don't unmask latent bugs — they hide bugs further. (They have their own discipline: regression test on the now-rejected inputs.)

## How to apply

At the moment of writing the fix, **before pushing the commit**:

1. **Identify the code path the fix unblocks.** Trace from the fix site outward: which functions / DOM elements / templates / consumers will now run / render / receive payloads they previously couldn't?
2. **Audit each downstream surface for the "first-time-reachable" hazards:**
   - Are all the fields / attributes / DOM nodes the downstream code reads actually populated for the now-reachable case?
   - Does the downstream code's existing test coverage exercise this newly-reachable path, or was it only tested via paths that bypass the buggy primitive?
   - Are there assertions, getters, or template bindings downstream that would render empty / null / undefined visibly to the user?
3. **Decide one of three responses per latent issue found:**
   - **Fix in the same commit / PR** when the latent issue is in the same file or a tightly-coupled file — the fix is the prompt; bundling is the natural scope.
   - **Fix as a follow-on commit on the same branch** when the latent issue needs server-side template changes or cross-app coordination that would balloon the primary fix's diff. Still ship in the same PR, but as a discrete commit so the trail is clear.
   - **File a follow-up IDEA / issue** only when the latent issue requires substantially more work than the primary fix and shipping the primary alone is genuinely better than holding both. Document the trade-off explicitly in the PR body so the reviewer sees the scope decision.

The **most common wrong response** to finding a latent issue during the audit: shipping the primary fix alone and "leaving the latent for later". This is the path the cycle math punishes — the latent surfaces in user smoke or in a follow-up review, costing the second-fix cycle the audit was meant to prevent.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Shipping the primary fix without an audit, then treating the smoke-surfaced latent as a separate "new edge case found while testing". It wasn't new — it was always there; the fix just made it visible.
- ❌ Auditing only the file the primary fix touches. Latent issues often live in template-binding sites, downstream getters, or consumer modules — the camouflage was at the primitive, the latent often is at the surface.
- ❌ "The latent has its own bug class — it's not part of this fix." True in isolation; false in context. The primary fix's effect on the latent's *visibility* couples them whether the codebase wants it or not.
- ❌ Defending shipping-primary-alone with "the latent existed before my fix". The user's experience starts from the moment the primary fix lands. Audit + bundle, or audit + explicit scope-decision in the PR body.

## Recurrence shape

A drawer's "open with prefix" routine used to push frames onto an empty stack without calling `open()`, so the drawer never appeared — the bug was invisible. The fix added the missing `open()` and the drawer rendered correctly. **But** the prefix frames themselves had always been constructed without a title field (the server emit + client parse contract only paired `<type>.<id>` tuples, never titles). While the drawer never opened, the missing titles were also invisible. The moment the `open()` fix landed, the drawer now appeared — with empty back-affordances and a blank title slot, freshly visible. The user reported the "regression", a second commit shipped the title-pairing fix, and the whole second cycle was avoidable with one audit pass at the time of the `open()` fix.

The same pattern recurs across stacks: a guard added to a primitive unmasks a contract gap in the data the primitive consumes. The audit catches both halves in one PR.

## Relationship to other rules and skills

- [`rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push`](../../../rules/RULE_self-sweep-before-push.md) — covers **structural** sweep (dead imports, unused locals, stale comments). This reference covers **behavioural** sweep (latent issues newly reachable). Both run pre-push but on different surfaces; one's pass-clean signal does not satisfy the other.
- [`rules/RULE_rename-before-drop`](../../../rules/RULE_rename-before-drop.md) — the "post-drop re-test" guidance there is the same shape as this reference's audit pass: a fix changes a code path's reach, and re-test catches the latent issues the prior code's behaviour was hiding. This reference generalises the discipline beyond rename-drop sequences.
- [`agents/AGENT_curator`](../../../agents/AGENT_curator.md) — surfaces during PASS 3 (Architecture & DRY)'s asymmetric-fix sweep when reviewing a bug-fix PR that removed a short-circuit.
- [`agents/AGENT_test-engineer`](../../../agents/AGENT_test-engineer.md) — surfaces during PASS 1 (Boundary Contradiction Sweep) when the fix newly exposes a code branch the boundary matrix didn't previously have to enumerate.
- the review loop ([`skills/review-loop/SKILL.md`](../../review-loop/SKILL.md)) — fires Phase 2, right after applying a Tier 1 / Tier 2 finding's edit and before committing: audit what the fix newly reaches, fold the latent fix into the same Phase 3 commit if scope allows.
