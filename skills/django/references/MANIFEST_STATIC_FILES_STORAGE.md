# `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` — `collectstatic` is not enough, restart the app server

**When this fires**: production / staging deployments using `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` (the recommended Django production-mode static backend) where `collectstatic` is run as part of a deploy. The django SKILL.md body's section holds the firing-conditions stub; this reference holds the trapdoor walkthrough + Makefile target shape + symptom-shape diagnostic.

## The trapdoor

Django's `ManifestStaticFilesStorage` hash-fingerprints every URL: `theme.css` is served as `theme.dd52cbcbcdb6.css`, the hash changes on every content change, browsers auto-bust cache on every deploy. This is the right default. The trapdoor: the hash → URL mapping lives in `staticfiles.json`, which **the app server reads once at process startup and caches in-memory for the worker's lifetime**.

After `collectstatic` runs:

- ✅ new hashed file exists on disk
- ✅ `staticfiles.json` has the new entry
- ❌ **but** the running app server's `{% static %}` template tag still resolves to the OLD hash

Result: the user reloads, the rendered HTML still references the old `theme.<oldhash>.css`, the browser fetches that URL successfully (it's still on disk under the old hash), and the user sees no change no matter how hard they refresh. A "hard refresh" (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+R) doesn't help — the URL emitted in HTML is the cached one, not the new one.

## The fix

```python
# settings.py — typical config
_STATICFILES_BACKEND = (
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.ManifestStaticFilesStorage'
    if not DEBUG
    else 'django.contrib.staticfiles.storage.StaticFilesStorage'
)
STORAGES = {
    'staticfiles': {'BACKEND': _STATICFILES_BACKEND},
}
```

```makefile
# ❌ insufficient: leaves the app server emitting the old hashed URL
static:
	docker compose exec web python manage.py compile_scss
	docker compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

# ✅ correct: pair the rebuild with a restart so {% static %} re-reads the manifest
static:
	docker compose exec web python manage.py compile_scss
	docker compose exec web python manage.py collectstatic --noinput

restart-web:
	docker compose restart web
```

The contract: every static-file change requires `make static && make restart-web` to land for users. This is the same shape as the env-var change-then-recreate pattern (`docker compose restart` doesn't pick up new ENV; you need `up -d --force-recreate`) — both are "the disk changed but the process is still on the old view."

## Symptom shape during debug

1. User reports "I refreshed and don't see my CSS / JS change."
2. Dev tools shows the page loaded `theme.<oldhash>.css`.
3. `curl https://example.com/static/.../theme.<oldhash>.css` returns the OLD content (because that's what's at the old-hash URL — the new content is at the new hash).
4. Restart the app server → next page load emits the NEW hashed URL → browser fetches NEW file → user sees the change.

Applies the same way to JS / image / font / any post-processed asset. Does not apply when `DEBUG=True` because `StaticFilesStorage` (no manifest) just resolves URLs to plain filenames at request time. The staging / production gotcha only.

## Test assertions on static names must be hash-robust

The second face of the same trapdoor: render-and-assert tests that check a script/asset reference by **literal filename substring** pass on every `DEBUG=True` dev box and fail on any `DEBUG=False` host — `{% static 'app/js/widget.js' %}` renders `app/js/widget.<hash>.js`, which does not contain the substring `widget.js`.

```python
# ❌ Fragile — green for years on dev boxes, fails the first time the suite
#    runs on a staging-shaped host (DEBUG=False → ManifestStaticFilesStorage):
self.assertContains(response, 'widget.js')
idx = body.find('app/js/widget.js')        # -1 under hashed URLs

# ✅ Hash-robust — match the stem with an optional content-hash segment:
self.assertRegex(body, r"app/js/widget(\.[0-9a-f]+)?\.js")
```

For script-**ordering** assertions (A must load before B), wrap the regex in a position helper rather than `str.find`:

```python
def find_static_asset(body: str, stem: str, ext: str = 'js') -> int:
    """Return the match offset of a static asset reference, or -1 (hash-robust)."""
    m = re.search(re.escape(stem) + r'(\.[0-9a-f]+)?\.' + re.escape(ext), body)
    return m.start() if m else -1
```

Put the helper in the project's shared test-utils package and grep the suite for existing `'.js'` / `'.css'` substring assertions when introducing it — this class of fragility accumulates invisibly because suites overwhelmingly run on DEBUG=True machines. Negative assertions (`assertNotContains(response, 'legacy.js')`) need the regex form too (`assertNotRegex`), or a hashed `legacy.<hash>.js` slips through.
